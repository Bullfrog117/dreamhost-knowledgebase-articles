<p>When you enable CloudFlare in your DreamHost panel, you have the choice between two types of subscriptions:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>CloudFlare Basic (free)</strong></dt>
<dd>All CloudFlare-enabled domains have access to the free Basic CloudFlare subscription at no cost.</dd>
<dt><strong>CloudFlare Plus ($9.95/month)</strong></dt>
<dd>The CloudFlare Plus subscription provides additional features such as SSL support and is $9.95 per month.</dd>
</dl>
<p>CloudFlare subscriptions are purchased from DreamHost and managed inside your DreamHost panel, and the one you choose controls which features are available for a CloudFlare-enabled domain.</p>
<p>For more information on CloudFlare and how to enable it, please see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-CloudFlare-overview">CloudFlare</a> article.</p>
<h2><span id="How_CloudFlare_subscriptions_work">How CloudFlare subscriptions work</span></h2>
<p>Any subscription you enable for a domain, along with all of the CloudFlare features for that plan, are available to ALL of its subdomains at no extra charge. Please note, however, that you must specifically enable CloudFlare on each subdomain.</p>
<p>To explain, a single subscription covers both example.com and any subdomains, such as blog.example.com. However, a different domain like dreamhostexample.com requires a separate CloudFlare subscription. You may enable CloudFlare for an unlimited number of subdomains.</p>

<h2><span id="Comparing_plans">Comparing plans</span></h2>
<h3><span id="DreamHost_subscriptions_vs._CloudFlare_subscriptions">DreamHost subscriptions vs. CloudFlare subscriptions</span></h3>
<p>As hosting partners with CloudFlare, DreamHost’s CloudFlare subscriptions provide you with many of the same benefits of using CloudFlare’s services directly inside your DreamHost panel. You don’t need to change your domain's nameservers to CloudFlare’s to get these benefits.</p>
<h3><span id="Cloudflare.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CFree.E2.80.9D_plan_vs._DreamHost.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CBasic_.28free.21.29.E2.80.9D_plan">Cloudflare’s “Free” plan vs. DreamHost’s “Basic (free!)” plan</span></h3>
<p>The only differences is that CloudFlare’s “Free” plan offers Universal SSL support and DNS management.</p>
<h3><span id="Cloudflare.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CPro.E2.80.9D_plan_vs._DreamHost.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CPlus.E2.80.9D_plan">Cloudflare’s “Pro” plan vs. DreamHost’s “Plus” plan</span></h3>
<p>CloudFlare also offers a “Pro” plan at $20 per month. There are three big differences between CloudFlare's Pro plan and DreamHost's Plus plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost's Plus plan does not have a <a class="external text" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf" rel="nofollow">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a></li>
<li>CloudFlare's Pro plan has a 15-minute delay vs. 1-hour delay (DreamHost Plus plan) on analytics</li>
<li>CloudFlare's Pro plan has 20 vs. 10 (DreamHost Plus plan) PageRules</li>
</ul>
