<h2>Setting your domain to DNS only</h2>
<p>You can add custom DNS records for a fully hosted domain as well as a domain set to DNS only. It all depends on what records you are creating and why you need them.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you want your site hosted on DreamHost's servers, keep your site as Fully Hosted. </p>
<p>However, if you want your site to point away from DreamHost by creating an A or CNAME record, the first step is to remove the hosting service already applied to your domain at DreamHost. The following steps explain how to set a domain to DNS only.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button under the ‘Web Hosting’ column for the domain.</li>
<li>On the following page, scroll down to the ‘DNS Only’ section: <img alt="01 Blogger.fw.png" height="303" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Blogger.fw.png" width="717"/></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Host DNS only!</strong> button to change your hosting for this domain from ‘Fully Hosted’ to ‘dns’.</li>
<li>Navigate to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 dns.png" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dns.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>To the right of the domain under the 'Web Hosting' column, click the <strong>Remove</strong> button. This sets the domain to DNS only.</li>
</ol>
<p>This also changes the non-editable DNS records into Custom DNS records that you can delete. The only remaining non-editable records are MX records which you can change on the <a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Mail' &gt; 'Custom MX'</a>) page.</p>
<p>Below are a few things to note regarding these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not press the <strong>Delete</strong> button for the domain through the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page. This removes the domain from the account along with the contents that were previously hosted under it.</li>
<li>Setting the domain to ‘DNS Only’ does not delete your hosted files. You can click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to set the domain as ‘Fully Hosted’. This recreates your DNS records for the domain.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that this only affects your web hosting service and leaves other things services like email intact (this assumes you already have an active hosting plan on your account). Email is not available with DreamHost unless your account has an active hosting plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally these changes are only possible for the primary domain – subdomains cannot be set to DNS Only.</p>

<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If this is your only domain on your account and you're setting it to DNS only, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only necessary if you wish to host a domain and its content on DreamHost servers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="A_record">A record</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>DNS</strong> link located under your domain on the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 Custom DNS A record.png" height="248" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Custom_DNS_A_record.png" width="500"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter the following in three fields to create the A record:
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: For the main domain, leave the ‘Name’ field blank. For ‘www’ or other subdomains, you can enter the subdomain name in this field.</li>
</ul>
<em>This field is often any of the following: </em>www<em>, </em>blog<em>, </em>dev<em>, </em>store<em>, and so on.</em>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Do not add the @ symbol into this field. This is added automatically.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: The record ‘Type’ defaults to ‘A’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Enter the IP address in the ‘Value’ field.</li>
</ul>
<em>This is the IP address you want this domain/subdomain to point to. </em></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The propagation for the new A record begins, and can take up to 6 hours before the new records update online.</p>
<h2><span id="CNAME_record">CNAME record</span></h2>
<p>Along with custom A records, you can point your hosting away from DreamHost with a CNAME record. This record is created to point one domain to another as opposed to pointing one domain to an IP address like the custom A record.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the <strong>root A record</strong> (for example, example.com) cannot be a CNAME record and must always be an A record.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the DNS link under the domain name on the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 Custom DNS CNAME record.png" height="247" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Custom_DNS_CNAME_record.png" width="500"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: This field can be anything. But very often it’s just www. Adding www points the www subdomain away from DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
<em>In the example above, the CNAME record is named 'calendar' and is pointing to 'ghs.google.com'.</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: In the drop-down menu select ‘CNAME’.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Enter the location you’d like this record to point to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>After clicking the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button, the propagation for the new record begins. This can take up to 6 hours before the new records update online.</p>

<h2><span id="SRV_record">SRV record</span></h2>
<p>SRV (service) records are another set of records that can be applied to your domain. Certain programs and applications may require the set up of these types of records to make those services active.</p>
<p>Your standard SRV record is in this type of format:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">_service._protocol.name. TTL class SRV priority weight port target.</pre>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>When entering an SRV record in your panel, ignore the TTL, class, and SRV fields. A full example is below.</p>
</div>

<p>The following two Microsoft SRV records are some of the more common SRV records that are configured for a domain. The example can be seen here:</p>

<p>Below is an example of how to set up one of the records above.</p>
<ol>
<li>In your panel, go to (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>).</li>
<li>Click the 'DNS' link under your domain name:
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 Custom DNS SRV record.png" height="245" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Custom_DNS_SRV_record.png" width="500"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: _sipfederationtls._tcp</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is the 'Service' followed by the 'Protocol'.</dd>
<dd>In the screenshot above, only one of the SRV record is being created. Repeat these steps for the second record.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: Select SRV from the dropdown menu.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: You need to enter the values in the order (priority) (weight) (port) (target)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using the example for MS mail hosting above, the first record’s value is:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">100 1 5061 sipfed.online.lync.com.</pre>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following values are used in the above example:
<dl>
<dd>priority = 100</dd>
<dd>weight = 1</dd>
<dd>port = 5061</dd>
<dd>target = sipfed.online.lync.com</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>After clicking the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button, the propagation for the new A record begins and can take up to 6 hours before the new records update online.</p>
<p>The two records look like this once created:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">_sipfederationtls._tcp	SRV	100 1 5061 sipfed.online.lync.com.

_sip._tls	        SRV	100 1 443 sipdir.online.lync.com.</pre>

<ul>
<li>As with all changes to DNS, these records need time to update online. You may find that it may take a few hours for things to start functioning. You can Flush the DNS to see if this speeds up the propagation process, but there are no guarantees this will help. You can read instructions on flushing the DNS here:</li>
