<p>The transfer process between DreamHost accounts is very similar to transferring a domain from an external provider. First, the account holder that is releasing the domain must prepare the domain for transfer in their own panel, by following the steps in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249878-How-do-I-transfer-my-domain-registration-away-from-DreamHost-">Transfer your domain registration away from DreamHost</a> article.</p>
<p>The account holder provides the authorization key/EPP code to the recipient of the domain. The recipient then follows the steps to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215250318-How-do-I-transfer-my-domain-registration-to-DreamHost-">initiate the transfer</a> in to their account.</p>
