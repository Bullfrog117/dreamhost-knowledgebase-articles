<p>This article details the process of moving your WordPress site from your current host to DreamHost.</p>
<p>If you're moving from <a class="external text" href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">WordPress.com</a> then you'll have to follow their official directions: <a class="external text" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/moving-a-blog/#moving-to-wordpress-org" rel="nofollow">Moving from .com to self-hosted WordPress</a></p>
<p>They also offer a <a class="external text" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/guided-transfer/" rel="nofollow">Guided Transfer</a>. Due to complications with the WordPress.com setup, if their official directions don't work properly, DreamHost strongly recommends you purchase the guided transfer.</p>

<p>Before making any changes to your website, DreamHost highly recommends backing up your database. Instructions can be found in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039758-How-do-I-backup-my-database-">Backup MySQL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But you may need to contact your current host for instructions on how to export in their system.</p>

<h2><span id="Migrating_all_of_your_files_manually" class="mw-headline">Migrating all of your files manually</span></h2>
<p>You are also able to manually migrate the entire site. In order to manually migrate your data, you'll need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup your database as a .sql file from your previous host.</li>
<li>Backup your web files via FTP from your previous host.</li>
<li>Create a MySQL hostname and database at DreamHost for the new installation.</li>
<li>Upload these files via FTP/SFTP/SSH to your DreamHost server.</li>
<li>Import your database to your DreamHost database server.</li>
<li>Update your wp-config.php file to point to your DreamHost database.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="Step_one_.E2.80.93_Backing_up_your_database" class="mw-headline">Step one – Backing up your database</span></h2>
<p>Before you do anything else, back up your MySQL database at your current host. The method of creating a backup differs from host to host. The simplest method is to use <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>, a web-based SQL manager available in many hosts' panels.</p>
<p>For further information, check with your current host on how to backup your database as a .sql file.</p>
<h2><span id="Step_two_.E2.80.93_Backing_up_your_web_files_via_FTP" class="mw-headline">Step two – Backing up your web files via FTP</span></h2>
<p>At your current host, back up all your web files via FTP/SFTP/SHELL. Visit the FTP article which explains how to do this with DreamHost:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to contact your current host to confirm what settings to use to connect to their server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Archive and compress your old WordPress installation at the current host before you proceed for quicker results. Contact your current host for instructions on how to do this.</li>
<li>You can then upload the single file to your DreamHost server and log in via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> to decompress it there. This is not necessary, but it may help to speed up the process if you have a large amount of data to transfer.</li>

<p>Once you have the backup files saved to your computer, make a new SQL hostname and a new, empty database for your WordPress installation in your DreamHost panel. You can create these on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Goodies’ &gt; ‘MySQL Databases’</a>) page.</p>

<p>Assuming you created the database in your DreamHost panel with the same hostname, username, password and database name as was set up at your previous host, your site may already appear online. If not, proceed to step#5 below</p>

<h2><span id="Step_five_.E2.80.93_Editing_wp-config.php" class="mw-headline">Step five – Editing wp-config.php</span></h2>
<p>It's likely that the hostname, database, username and password that you created in your DreamHost panel differs from the one on your previous host. If that's the case you'll need to update your wp-config.php file to make sure that the information matches the login credentials for your new database in the DreamHost panel.</p>
<p>Open the wp-config.php file and you’ll see the following contents:</p>

<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/06_Move_WordPress_wpconfig.fw.png" alt="06 Move WordPress wpconfig.fw.png" width="506" height="341" /></dd>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Make sure that the table_prefix setting in wp-config.php matches your backup table prefix, otherwise WordPress will prompt you to install from scratch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To confirm the table prefix, use phpMyAdmin to log into the database at DreamHost you’ve just imported in Step#4 above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once logged in, click your database name on the left. You'll see the tables appear underneath.</li>
<li>The first part of the table is the prefix. In the above example, the prefix is wp_q2e97u_.</li>
<li>Update your wp-config.php file's prefix field to match this table prefix.</li>
