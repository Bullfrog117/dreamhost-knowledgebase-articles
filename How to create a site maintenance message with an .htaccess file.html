<p>If your site is going into maintenance, you can forward visitors to your site to a maintenance message automatically. First, you must create a file named 'maintenance.html' in your web directory. Then, add the following to your .htaccess file:</p>
<pre>Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/maintenance.html$
RewriteRule .* /maintenance.html [L]
</pre>
<p>If you now visit the site, it automatically loads the contents of the maintenance.html file, but the URL does not change.</p>
<p>You can replace <tt>[L]</tt> with <tt>[R=307,L]</tt> if you prefer that the user see the URL change to example.com/maintenance.html. However, this is usually not what you want.</p>
