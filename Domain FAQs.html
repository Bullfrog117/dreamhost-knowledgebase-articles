The only service that’s limited to a single domain is <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> hosting.

<p>You have a few options. Please visit the guide on <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Viewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">viewing your site before the DNS change using a dreamhosters.com subdomain.</a></p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_access_the_domain_using_an_IP_address.3F">Can I access the domain using an IP address?</span></h2>
<p>The only way this is possible is if you purchase a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a>. Then your site will have a specific IP assigned. Otherwise, this is not possible.</p>
<h2><span id="I_fully-hosted_my_domain._Where_is_the_public_html.3F">I fully-hosted my domain. Where is the public_html?</span></h2>
<p>When fully hosting your domain, you are prompted to enter a web directory. This directory is where you place the content on your web server. Drop in your index file in the web directory so it displays when you visit your page. This web directory is the same as your “public_html” folder. Visit the Adding Domains &amp; Subdomains article for details.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_upload_and_access_my_domain_files.3F">How can I upload and access my domain files?</span></h2>
<p>Using a client, you can access the server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>. You can also use a terminal to access it via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.

<h2><span id="Can_I_host_a_subdomain_only.3F">Can I host a subdomain only?</span></h2>
<p>Yes. Simply add the primary domain in the panel, then the subdomain. You’ll then be able to view the IP address for the subdomain. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Adding a domain</a> article for details.</p>

<p>If you recently added hosting to the domain, it can take anywhere from 4-8 hrs to resolve online. Tools like <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">whatsmydns.net</a> can be used to check on the DNS propagation status.</p>
