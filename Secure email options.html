<p>SMTP, IMAP, and POP / POP3 are unencrypted transmission protocols by default (like HTTP). One method to run them securely is to use TLS, or its predecessor SSL, as in HTTPS.</p>
<p>Secure ports for incoming and outgoing connections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure IMAP - port 993 (incoming)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure POP3 - port 995 (incoming)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure SMTP - port 465 (outgoing)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Some clients will set the port automatically when you select TLS/SSL, or select TLS/SSL automatically when you select the appropriate port. Other clients will require that you make both selections in order to fully configure SSL for the appropriate service.</p>
</div>

<p>Another method uses STARTTLS. The STARTTLS method connects to the regular SMTP/IMAP/POP3 port and then upgrades the connection to TLS by sending a STARTTLS request. Some email clients refer to this as "TLS" and the method of directly using encryption to a different port as "SSL". This distinction is technically incorrect!</p>

<dd>Your login information and email messages are sent in encrypted form, so people can't eavesdrop on them.</dd>
<dt>Server authentication</dt>
<dd>With certificates properly set up, you can check that the IMAP/POP server that you're connecting to is the correct machine (and not an impostor that just wants to steal your password.) The server provides a certificate (public key) which corresponds to a private key on the IMAP/POP server. Once the client knows that the server's public key is authentic, it can validate communications from that server.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are particularly useful if using public Wi-Fi, which may not be encrypted – these ensure that people can’t read your email by listening to the network, nor can they (more intrusively) set up a fake email server to capture your emails.</p>

<li>For wireless, you should really be using WPA2, but that’s not always available.</li>
