<p>To access your MySQL database, you need a unique hostname (domain name) or IP address for your MySQL server. This hostname can be any name you wish, so long as you have registered it, but it is commonly a subdomain of your primary domain and is named "mysql.example.TLD". For example, letâ€™s say your domain is example.com: you can then create the subdomain "mysql.example.com" which is used to connect to your database server.</p>
<p>This arrangement is convenient to use with DreamHost's MySQL installations, as you can create and manage all of your databases from the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'MySQL Databases'</a>) page.</p>
<p>However, during a server or web host migration, the DNS for "example.tld" may not point to DreamHost's nameservers, so you won't be able to use a subdomain of "example.tld" for the MySQL hostname.</p>
<p>With DreamHost's setup, your MySQL server (which hosts all of your databases) is accessible from <em><strong>any</strong></em> subdomain that you assign to it within your DreamHost account. Thus, you can still access any of your DreamHost-hosted MySQL databases by creating a temporary MySQL subdomain within your panel.</p>
