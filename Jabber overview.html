<p>Jabber/XMPP (<strong>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol</strong> formerly named Jabber) is an open source, decentralized Instant Messaging protocol that DreamHost offers free of charge on Shared, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>, and <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> hosting plans.</p>

<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> does not offer free Jabber service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br/> The protocol is built to be extensible and other features such as Voice over IP and file transfers have been added. XMPP gives you an IM address of the same format as an email address, and you can keep your same Jabber ID @example.com even if you switch providers.</p>
<p>The great thing about XMPP on DreamHost is that you can host your own XMPP chat server on your domain.</p>

<li>Once saved you’ll see the user is pending activation. Give it some time before it’s configured on the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now download any Jabber client you like to connect to the service.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_change_an_XMPP_user.27s_password.3F">How do I change an XMPP user's password?</span></h2>
<p>You should change XMPP user passwords in the panel on the <a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.jabber&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; ‘Goodies’ &gt; ‘Jabber IM’</a>) page.</p>
<p>It's recommended to change it here since the user info is maintained in a database by DreamHost. If you update it in your client, you may need to contact DreamHost to reset it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="XMPP_clients">XMPP clients</span></h2>
<p>There are various XMPP clients you can use. Visit the following link for a list of clients:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_use_XMPP_instead_of_another_IM_service.3F">Why use XMPP instead of another IM service?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>XMPP is decentralized. There is no one point of failure for communications. This also means you are in control of your own instant messaging destiny, rather than being at the mercy of AOL, Microsoft, or Yahoo.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>XMPP is open. No company controls the protocol, and anybody can (and has) written plug-ins and clients for it. XMPP can also communicate with all the major proprietary IM systems through public gateways.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can make your IM address be the same as your email address (@example.com), rather than something like 19015012 or some strange impersonal name.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>XMPP supports "resources" which are multiple locations for the same user account. No more setting up multiple accounts for your home, work, and laptop. In XMPP you just have user@example.com/home, user@example.com/work, and user@example.com/laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Secure_connections">Secure connections</span></h2>
<p>In order for secure Jabber to work, you must have a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">Secure Certificate</a> and a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109627-How-do-I-add-or-remove-a-Unique-IP">Unique IP</a> set up for the domain on which you're using Jabber.</p>
<p>If an SSL is already used on the domain, you'll be able to use Jabber securely when you set up Jabber users on that domain.</p>
<p>Make sure you set the port to 5222 on your Jabber account.</p>

<p>Check the following if you're having connection issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>You've created an XMPP user via the panel and its status is active.</li>
<li>You have the right server/domain name, username, and password (check your CAPS lock).</li>
<li>Your network connection is functioning normally.</li>
<li>Your website itself is up and hosted with DreamHost. If not, it's not XMPP that's broken, it's something more general with your domain.</li>
