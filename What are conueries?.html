<p>"Conueries" is a term DreamHost came up with to measure MySQL database usage. The word is a combination of "connections" and "queries", as that is what the unit is derived from. Basically, the number of MySQL queries you have in a month, plus 25 times the number of connections you have is your total "conueries" for a month.</p>

</ul>
<p>They are no hard limits on conueries. DreamHost still tracks them, but unless you're in the top .01% of database users, you'll never need to worry about them again. DreamHost reserves the right to have ultra-heavy users curtail their database usage or switch to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server. However this would only be an issue with an extremely inefficient site receiving thousands of visitors a day.</p>
