<p><strong>Sinatra</strong> <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a DSL for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</p>
<p>Since DH supports <a title="Passenger" href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger">Passenger</a>, which in turn supports Rack-based ruby applications, you should be able to run Sinatra with no issues.</p>
<p>The Sinatra Book had an excellent section on how to deploy your Sinatra application to Dreamhost, which is in the sinatra recipes repo now <a class="external autonumber" href="https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/blob/master/deployment/dreamhost_via_passenger.md" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>If you encounter this error after following the instructions in the book,</p>
<pre> canâ€™t activate rack (&gt;= 0.9.1, &lt; 1.0, runtime), already activated rack-0.4.0
</pre>
<p>then add the following two lines to the beginning of your config.ru.</p>
<pre> require '/home/USERNAME/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/rack-&lt;VERSION-OF-RACK-GEM-YOU-HAVE-INSTALLELD&gt;/lib/rack.rb'
 require '/home/USERNAME/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/sinatra-&lt;VERSION-OF-SINATRA-GEM-YOU-HAVE-INSTALLELD&gt;/lib/sinatra.rb'
</pre>
