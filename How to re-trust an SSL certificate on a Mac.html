<p>On January 19 2017, DreamHost updated the SSL certificates on all mail servers. Because the SSL certificate was updated, you will see a message next time you open your mail client. This message will ask you to accept the new certificate. This certificate is completely safe for you to accept. Once your mail client saves the new certificate, your email client will function normally again. View the following article for further details:</p>

<p><strong>Mac Mail users:</strong> There have been a few reported issues with Mac Mail not saving the new certificate at first. Try several times to accept the certificate with the 'Continue' button. Some users report that after a few tries, the certificate is saved. If it still cannot connect after these attempts, use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the Mail Server name on your account</a>. For example, sub5.mail.dreamhost.com. You can see which mail cluster your account users in the panel on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Support &gt; Data Centers')</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone users:</strong> First, try going to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts'. Click the account and address, then re-enter the hostname. If this doesn't work, try setting up the email account like new. Go to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts &gt; Add Account'. It will show the message "Cannot Verify Server Identity". Click "Details" below that message, followed by "Trust" in the top-right corner. Similar to the suggestion above, you may need to repeat this process 2-3 times to take effect permanently. You can also use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the server/host name</a> with this setup.</p>

<p>In rare cases, Mac OS may retain past SSL certificates despite the Mail account having been removed and Keychain Access being emptied of related certificates and passwords. If you find that any of the above steps do not resolve the issue, try removing your account completely from Mail, clear out Keychain Access of *mail.dreamhost.com certificates, and remove any saved passwords for your account. Then, reboot your Mac to flush any remaining configuration of the account from your system. Once the machine logs back in, you can proceed to re-add your email account in Mail.</p>
