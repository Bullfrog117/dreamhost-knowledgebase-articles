<p>On January 19 2017, DreamHost updated the SSL certificates on all mail servers. Because the SSL certificate was updated, you will see a message next time you open your mail client. This message will ask you to accept the new certificate. This certificate is completely safe for you to accept. Once your mail client saves the new certificate, your email client will function normally again. View the following article for futher details:</p>

<p><strong>Mac Mail users:</strong> There have been a few reported issues with Mac Mail not saving the new certificate at first. Try several times to accept the certificate with the 'Continue' button. Some users report that after a few tries, the certificate is saved. If it still cannot connect after these attempts, use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the Mail Server name on your account</a>. For example, sub5.mail.dreamhost.com. You can see which mail cluster your account users in the panel on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Support &gt; Data Centers')</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone users:</strong> First, try going to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts'. Click the account and address, then re-enter the hostname. If this doesn't work, try setting up the email account like new. Go to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts &gt; Add Account'. It will show the message "Cannot Verify Server Identity". Click "Details" below that message, followed by "Trust" in the top-right corner. Similar to the suggestion above, you may need to repeat this process 2-3 times to take effect permanently. You can also use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the server/host name</a> with this setup.</p>

<p>When connecting to a DreamHost mail server with SSL enabled, Mail will issue a warning because the root certificate's domain name won't match your mail server's domain name. To fix this problem, you can tell Mail to ignore the discrepancy using one of the three methods described below.</p>
<h2><span id="Method_one">Method one</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open up Mail and allow the “Verify Certificate” window to pop up.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Show Certificate</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>The pop up expands and shows the certificate is for the hostname *.mail.dreamhost.com:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Check the box to the left of “Always trust “.mail.dreamhost.com” when connecting to “mail.example.com”.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>You are prompted for your password to update the changes in your keychain:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter your credentials for your Apple Mac, NOT your email password.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Update Settings</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That fixes the cert verification warnings. When fetching or sending mail, you may get prompted to enter your email password: simply enter your password for your email address and then click the checkbox to save the password in your keychains.</p>

<h2><span id="If_you_need_further_help">If you need further help</span></h2>
<p>In rare cases, Mac OS may retain past SSL certificates despite the Mail account having been removed and Keychain Access being emptied of related certificates and passwords. If you find that any of the above steps do not resolve the issue, try removing your account completely from Mail, clear out Keychain Access of *mail.dreamhost.com certificates, and remove any saved passwords for your account. Then, reboot your Mac to flush any remaining configuration of the account from your system. Once the machine logs back in, you can proceed to re-add your email account in Mail.</p>
