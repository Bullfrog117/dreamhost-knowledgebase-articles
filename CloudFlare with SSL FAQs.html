<p>If any of the following limitations are not acceptable to you, then the only option is to disable CloudFlare on the domain.</p>

<h2><span id="How_long_will_it_take_to_set_up.3F">How long will it take to set up?</span></h2>
<p>When setting up SSL or Secure Hosting, you may need to wait some time for DNS changes to propagate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can sometimes take up to several hours.</li>
<li>Additionally, you may need to wait up to 24 hours for CloudFlare to set up your SSL certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until the setup completes, you may be unable to connect to your site over https, or you may receive invalid SSL certificate warnings.</p>
<h2><span id="What_certificate_will_visitors_to_my_site_see.3F">What certificate will visitors to my site see?</span></h2>
<p>Visitors to your site will only ever see the certificate that CloudFlare creates.</p>
<p>The certificate you set up in the DreamHost panel (self-signed, professional, or custom) will <strong>NOT</strong> be visible to your site visitors if the site is using CloudFlare. CloudFlare always uses a "professional" certificate, but you will not have any control over this certificate.</p>
<p>Visitors will see a certificate that looks like this if they check the info on your site's certificate (regardless of what kind of certificate you have set up in the DreamHost panel):</p>

</dl>
<h2><span id="How_long_will_it_take_for_the_certificate_to_set_up.3F">How long will it take for the certificate to set up?</span></h2>
<p>It may take up to 24 hours for the certificate to be fully set up.</p>
<p>Until CloudFlare finishes setting up the SSL certificate for your site, you will see SSL warnings when visiting your site using HTTPS. Once the certificate is set up (which should be within 24 hours), the SSL warnings should go away.</p>
<h2><span id="What_about_second-level_subdomains_and_SSL_warnings.3F">What about second-level subdomains and SSL warnings?</span></h2>
<p>Second level subdomains may have SSL warnings.</p>
<p>This means that if you try to set up SSL and CloudFlare for <code>www.myblog.example.com</code>, you may see warnings like this when visiting the page:</p>
<p><img alt="07 CloudFlare SSL cert warning.fw.png" height="365" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/07_CloudFlare_SSL_cert_warning.fw.png" width="359"/></p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>This warning won't appear on <strong>first level</strong> subdomains like <code>myblog.example.com</code> or <code>www.example.com</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="What_happens_if_I_don.27t_enable_CloudFlare_on_the_main_domain.3F">What happens if I don't enable CloudFlare on the main domain?</span></h2>
<p>You will receive SSL warnings if CloudFlare is not enabled on the main domain.</p>
<p>If you want SSL to work on any of your subdomains with CloudFlare, you will need to also have your main domain (without any subdomains) also enabled on CloudFlare. This is a limitation imposed by the SSL Certificate provider; without the main domain being on CloudFlare, the certificate will not be valid for the subdomains.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to have SSL enabled on <code>blog.example.com</code> and use CloudFlare, then you must also enable CloudFlare on <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_use_CloudFlare.E2.80.99s_Universal_SSL_option.3F">Can I use CloudFlare’s Universal SSL option?</span></h2>
<p>At this time, the Universal SSL option is not available to CloudFlare customers that signed up through a CloudFlare hosting partner. CloudFlare is trying to work on the technical limitations to offer Universal SSL to all accounts. For further information, please visit CloudFlare’s support page:</p>
