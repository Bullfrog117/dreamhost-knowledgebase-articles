<p>Your DreamHost panel offers a domain restore option to restore your domain. You can find that option on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">‘Panel’ &gt; 'Domains' &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page for each domain listed:</p>

<li>Choose from the following sections:
<ul>
<li><strong>Available Backup Dates:</strong> There are three time-frame options available for your domain’s backups:</li>
<ul>
<li>1 hour to 1 day</li>
<li>1 day to 2 weeks</li>
<li>2 weeks or possibly more</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Restore Options:</strong> The two options allow you to either restore the selected backups to your current live site or restore the selected backups as a separate folder.</li>
</ul>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Copy the backup files to: /home/username/example.com_TIMESTAMP</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>If the restore is set to restore to a different folder, that folder is then created and named as the directory name plus the date and time it's processed.</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Make the backup copy live and back up all the current live files to
/home/username/example.com_TIMESTAMP
</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>The second option keeps the current site contents live. The old live directory name is then changed to that directory name plus the date and time it's processed.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the blue <strong>Restore example.com now!</strong> button to complete this process. (Replace the domain name listed in the button with your own domain name being restored.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you click the <strong>Restore</strong> button, you are redirected back to the ‘Manage Domains’ page where you see a green message at the top of the page stating that the restore is processing and will complete based on how large the backups are. You are notified via email once that completes.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>As stated on the restore page for your domain, DreamHost does not guarantee the backups for your domains. It is highly advised that you always keep local backups of your site contents just in case a DreamHost backup is not available.</p>
