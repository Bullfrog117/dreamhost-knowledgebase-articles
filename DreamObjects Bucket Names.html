<p>When choosing a name for your bucket, you’ll need to be careful to select something that’s DNS-compliant. That’s because your bucket names are used as part of the hostname in the URL when accessing its contents.</p>
<p>As of September 2017, DreamHost is enforcing the following stricter rule set for new bucket names.</p>
<h2>New Bucket Naming Rules</h2>
<p>The following are the new rules that will enforced. Each bucket name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be 3–63 characters long</li>
<li>Can only have:</li>
<ul>
<li>ASCII lowercase letters</li>
<li>ASCII numbers</li>
<li>periods (.)</li>
<li>hyphens (-)</li>
</ul>
<li>Cannot have a period (.) and hyphen (-) next to each other (adjacent)</li>
<li>Cannot include any Unicode characters, emoji, or non-printable ASCII</li>
<li>Must NOT be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is DreamHost enforcing this?</h2>
<p>Many S3-compatible clients have already enforced these stricter rules when creating new buckets. If you use a client that doesn’t enforce all of these rules, DreamObjects will return an error stating the bucket name is invalid.</p>
<p>If your client shows you the HTTP error response, you’ll see a <span class="code">400 InvalidBucketName</span> response code, including a link to this article.</p>
