<p>DreamHost's Deluxe WordPress install is the default and free One-Click <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> installation you can set up in your DreamHost panel. You can enable it by keeping the box checked in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>The Deluxe install comes with a few choice customizations to make it easy for beginners to get started such as free, open source themes from Automattic, a standard selection of plugins, and a security enhancement.</p>

<p>Includes a selection of free, open source, themes from Automattic.</p>

<p>DreamHost's One-Click Install also includes the following popular plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/">Akismet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">JetPack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/">wpforms-lite</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Though these plugins are installed by default for deluxe installations, you may need activate them in your WordPress dashboard by going to ‘Plugins’ &gt; ‘Installed Plugins’.</p>
<h2><span id="Security_enhancement">Security enhancement</span></h2>
<p>Additionally, this One-Click install adds protection against execution of scripts within your uploads directory.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, this means an .htaccess file with the following contents, within your /wp-content/uploads/ directory, is automatically added:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">### Generated by DreamHost. DO NOT modify!!! ###
SetHandler no-handler
################################################</pre>
</div>
<p>If your site is compromised through the placing of a malicious script in your uploads directory, the script is returned as a download when accessed. This keeps the script from running and helps to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>In the future, DreamHost will add additional security enhancements as well.</p>
