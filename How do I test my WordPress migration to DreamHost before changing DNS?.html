<p>This article is only necessary if your DNS is still pointed to your old host and you wish to see your site at DreamHost before changing your DNS.</p>

<p>View the following article for full instructions on how to view your WordPress site at DreamHost before you point your DNS:</p>

</ul>
<p>When this is completed, you can then view your site at your dreamhosters.com subdomain. Also note that some of your images/links may still be hard-coded to the original URL for your site. To change these, you can use a search and replace the plugin. Below are a couple of plugins that will work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/" rel="nofollow">Velvet Blues Update URLs</a></li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-and-replace/" rel="nofollow">Search and Replace</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you've done everything correctly, your domain will now resolve to your WordPress installation on your DreamHost account. If you need to check if the domain is pointing to the right server, upload a text file to your domain's root directory on your DreamHost server (but not your old server) and try to access that file via a web browser. If it's there, that means your domain is now pointing to the correct place.</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't make any edits on your WordPress installation during the 48-hour waiting period, since any changes that you make or any new content that you add will not carry over to your DreamHost account unless you re-transfer the database as described in the following article.</p>

</ul>
<p>The easiest way to access your site's files during the transition period is by entering your servername as the hostname in your FTP/SFTP/SSH program. You can view the correct server name on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Billing &amp; Account’ &gt; ‘Manage Account’</a>) page. For example if your server is named flower, the hostname you’d enter into your FTP client would be flower.dreamhost.com.</p>
