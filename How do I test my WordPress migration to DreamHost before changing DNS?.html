<p>When this is completed, you can then view your site using a 'Mirror' domain in your DreamHost account, or by adjusting your computer's 'hosts' file.</p>

<p>After you have viewed your 'Mirror' site to confirm your WordPress installation appears as it should, you are now ready to update your DNS. View the following article for instructions on how to update your nameservers are your current registrar:</p>

<p>If you've done everything correctly, your domain will now resolve to your WordPress installation on your DreamHost account. If you need to check if the domain is pointing to the right server, upload a text file to your domain's root directory on your DreamHost server (but not your old server) and try to access that file via a web browser. If it's there, that means your domain is now pointing to the correct place.</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't make any edits on your WordPress installation during the 48-hour waiting period, since any changes that you make or any new content that you add will not carry over to your DreamHost account unless you re-transfer the database as described in the following article.</p>
