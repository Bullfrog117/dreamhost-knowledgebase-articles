<p>CloudFlare is a service that provides various tools that help you accelerate and optimize your website, and DreamHost is an "Optimized Hosting Partner" of CloudFlare.</p>
<ul>
<li>CloudFlare's primary feature is its <a class="external text" href="http://www.cloudflare.com/features-cdn" rel="nofollow">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a>, which provides web content optimization technologies that improve how quickly resources on your site load.</li>
<li>It provides visitor data via its custom analytics and additional security through enhanced security features. Some features can be configured in the DreamHost panel while others need to be managed directly at CloudFlare using a free CloudFlare.com account.</li>
<li>It is also only available on fully hosted domains – if you host your DNS elsewhere, you must take additional steps to enable CloudFlare.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Do_I_need_to_use_CloudFlare.3F">Do I need to use CloudFlare?</span></h2>
<p>Depending on your situation, you may not need to use CloudFlare.</p>
<p>However, it’s an available option which may help to optimize your site even further. When visitors request cached content from your site, they connect and download the content from the closest CloudFlare server possible instead of connecting directly to the DreamHost server. As a result, this shortens the amount of time it takes for pages to load.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways CloudFlare can benefit your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: A responsive, fast site increases user satisfaction and encourages repeat visits.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Server Load</strong>: Caching your content in a CDN reduces the load on your server and the bandwidth used. DreamHost provides unlimited bandwidth for all hosting plans so this is not so much of a concern as reducing the server resources.</li>
<li><strong>High traffic</strong>: Using a CDN properly can mitigate or reduce the impact that a heavy surge in traffic that may occur on your site.</li>
</ul>
