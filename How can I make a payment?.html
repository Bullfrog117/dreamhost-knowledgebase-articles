<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_notes_regarding_your_payment">Important notes regarding your payment</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Credit card payments will post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it takes some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process.</li>
<li>If you have a balance due immediately, or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a payment clears, it will be applied to your account and DreamHost will send you a receipt for the payment to your account profile email address. Bank statements will show the charge as coming from ‘DreamHost - DH-FEE.com’.</p>
