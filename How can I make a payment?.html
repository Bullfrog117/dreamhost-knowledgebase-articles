<ul>
<li>Credit card payments will post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it takes some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process.</li>
<li>If you have a balance due immediately, or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</li>
