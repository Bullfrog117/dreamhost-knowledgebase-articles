<p>This article provides information on what to do if you currently own a domain registration that was previously purchased through DreamHost's now-inactive ‘New TLD’ portal which was managed by the domain registrar, eNom. When that page was enabled, it allowed users to purchase certain top-level domains (TLDs) that the DreamHost system wasn’t designed to support.</p>
<p>This includes premium domain names which require higher pricing due to what the registry defines as a widely sought after domain name (e.g., john.ninja, the name ‘john’ being a popular first name).</p>
<p>It also includes domain registration extensions, or TLDs, such as ‘.BIO’, which is a TLD that DreamHost does not offer through the <a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Registrations'</a>) page for purchase, but did allow through the ‘New TLD’ portal managed by eNom, which has been removed from all DreamHost accounts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_should_I_do.3F">What should I do?</span></h2>
<p>Because DreamHost does not support such domains, an eNom account has been created for you. An email was sent to you when the eNom account was created and provides further details on what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order for DreamHost to "push" your domain registration(s) to the eNom account, you must make a few edits to your account and submit the changes to eNom. This is so you can manage them in the future.</li>
<li>The following information describes how to access these accounts, what information you need to view/save, and where to go to submit your account information.</li>
<li>This article only applies to customers that purchased domain registrations through the 'New TLD' portal page in the past, but are unable to manage those domain registrations via the current DreamHost panel.</li>
