<p>If you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">added an SSL certificate</a> to your domain, you can force all visits to your site to use HTTPS to ensure your traffic is secure. This page lists examples on how to do this depending on how your site is hosted.</p>
<p>View either of the following articles for instructions on how to create/edit an .htaccess file on your server.</p>

<p>Please note that your FTP client must be configured to show hidden files. If not, you will not see the .htaccess file. View the following article for details on how to view hidden files:</p>

<h2><span id="Forcing_the_domain_to_serve_securely_using_HTTPS">Forcing the domain to serve securely using HTTPS</span></h2>
<p>The following forces any http request to be rewritten using https. For example, the following code forces a request to <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> to load <a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a>:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</pre>
</div>
<p>The following alternative also forces directly linked resources (images, css, etc.) to use https:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301] 
</pre>
</div>
<p>If this isn't working for you, first check your line endings. Copy/paste from your web browser into a text editor may not work right, so after pasting into your text editor you should delete each line break and add it back in (line break = return key).</p>
<h2><span id="An_extra_secure_method_to_force_a_domain_to_only_use_SSL_.28HTTPS.29">Force a domain to only use SSL (HTTPS) when using an .htaccess file to create a login prompt</span></h2>
<p>This method fixes a double login problem if you're using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363187-How-do-I-password-protect-my-site-">.htaccess file to create a login prompt</a>. This prevents submission of an .htaccess password prompt on an unencrypted connection. If you wish to ensure that your server is only serving documents over an encrypted SSL channel, then you must use the SSLRequireSSL directive with the +StrictRequire Option enabled:</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>

<p>The code below may cause a '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539558-Let-s-Encrypt-SSL-certificate-overview">Let's Encrypt</a>' certificate to not renew properly. If you have added a 'Let's Encrypt' certificate to your domain, make sure to disable the code below in your .htaccess file when your certificate is about to renew. Once renewed, you can re-enable the code below.</p>
