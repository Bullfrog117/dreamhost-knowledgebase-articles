<h2><span id="Proving_non-profit_status" class="mw-headline">Proving non-profit status</span></h2>
<p>Whether you are a new customer or a current customer, in order to prove your non-profit status DreamHost must receive one crucial piece of documentation: an official United States IRS letter indicating tax exempt non-profit status under the appropriate sections of the tax code. This is often called a <strong>501(c)(3) determination letter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A 501(c)(3) determination letter is the only documentation that DreamHost accepts.</strong> If you are a non-profit organization and do not have a determination letter, regardless of the reason, you will be denied free hosting.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>For individual organizations, this unfortunately requires a determination fee from the IRS. However, it is possible that your organization is covered by some kind of group exemption. If that is the case, DreamHost requires a copy of your parent organization's 501(c)(3) determination letter and proof from them that you are a subordinate in good standing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once the above information is received, DreamHost will configure your account for free non-profit hosting.</p>
