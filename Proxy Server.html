<p>On a <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058" title="DreamHost PS">DreamHost VPS</a> (Virtual Private Server), you may configure Proxy Servers. These can be configured on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.proxy&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Mongrel and Proxy')</a> page in the <a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/" rel="nofollow">DreamHost panel</a>.</p>
<h2>Technicalities</h2>
<p>The Proxy Server feature is a reverse proxy using Apache <a class=" " href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a>.</p>
<p>mod_proxy forwards requests that Apache receives on to another running process through a specific port. For example, if you wanted to set up Rails with Mongrel, you could have the Mongrel server running in the background and just have mod_proxy send incoming requests through Mongrel.</p>
<p>You can only forward requests to daemons bound to all hosts, and only on ports above 8000.</p>
<h2><span id="Daemon_Processes">Daemon Processes</span></h2>
<p>A <strong>daemon process</strong> is a server process that listens for communication from remote <em>clients</em>. For example, the Apache Web server is a daemon that listens for TCP socket connections from Web browser client applications. Some servers, such as TeamSpeak or game servers, might also listen for UDP packets.</p>
<p>A DreamHost VPS (or <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658">Dedicated Server)</a> account permits you to run daemon server processes. They will be limited to the server resources (CPU/RAM) you pay for. This differs from a shared hosting plan, where these processes could adversely affect other users on the same server.</p>
<p>Daemon processes that bind to a port (on which they listen for incoming connections) will be visible from the Internet. DreamHost does not employ any sort of firewall or port blocking on their network.</p>
