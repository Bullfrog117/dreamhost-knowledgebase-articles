<p>You can always find the billing address in your panel, on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.payment&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Billing &amp; Account’ &gt; ‘Make Payment’</a>) page.</p>
<h2><span id="Are_there_any_special_details_to_consider_when_making_a_payment_by_mail.3F">Are there any special details to consider when making a payment by mail?</span></h2>
<p>There are a few things you will want to keep in mind if you are submitting a payment via mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are mailing in a check payment, please make sure that you write your account number on the check. This is to ensure that the payment is processed to the correct account. If your check does not have the account number listed, this may cause problems and delay the processing of your payment.</li>
<li>It can take 4–5 weeks for a check payment to clear and be applied to your account. Please mail in your check payment early to ensure that your account is not suspended while DreamHost waits for your financial institution to approve the funds. If you need a payment extension or mailed the check late, please contact the DreamHost support team on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Contact Support'</a>) page to request an extension.</li>
<li>Because DreamHost uses a mailbox service that makes weekly deliveries of mail, other mailed payments (such as money orders) can take up to two weeks to post to your account.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="How_do_I_update_my_billing_or_contact_details.3F">How do I update my billing or contact details?</span></h2>
<p>If your billing details or contact information change, you will also want to update your information in your panel so you do not miss any important notices. This also designates who is specified as the owner of the account and who is authorized to contact DreamHost support for account specific issues.</p>
<p>To modify your billing and contact details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your DreamHost panel directly in your DreamHost panel at <a class="external free" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com" rel="nofollow">https://panel.dreamhost.com</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.over&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; 'HOME' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.
