<p>If you do not want to completely replace your site files, you can still manually remove and replace specific content. However, this is not recommended as it’s much easier to miss any infected files.</p>
<h2><span id=".htaccess_file">.htaccess file</span></h2>
<p>Many hackers insert code into the standard WordPress .htaccess file. The best thing to do is to completely remove the old, hacked .htaccess and generate a new one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your FTP client is set to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">view hidden files</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the old hacked .htaccess file (if it exists).</li>
<li>In your WordPress Dashboard, go to 'Setting &gt; Permalinks' and re-save its permalink settings.
<ul>
<li>The direct URL for the page is <a href="http://example.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php</a> (replace example.com with your WordPress site).</li>
<li>This re-creates the base .htaccess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have WP Super Cache plugin installed, go to 'Settings &gt; WP SuperCache' (<a href="http://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpsupercache" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpsupercache</a>), and then re-choose "Use mod_rewrite to serve cache files. (Recommended)"</li>
<li>Click <strong>Update Status</strong>.
<dl>
<dd><em>A yellow pop-up section appears titled "Mod Rewrite Rules":</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of that section, click the <strong>Update Mod-Rewrite Rules</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s very important to always keep your plugins up to date. This limits the possibility of getting hacked.</p>
<h3><span id="Updating_plugins_in_the_WordPress_dashboard">Updating plugins in the WordPress dashboard</span></h3>
<p>The WordPress dashboard notifies you if there are any updates for your installed plugins. You’ll see this in the left hand column next to ‘Plugins’:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="03 WP Hacked.fw.png" height="151" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/03_WP_Hacked.fw.png" width="148"/></dd>

<ul>
<li>You can update each plugin individually by clicking the ‘update now’ link below the plugin.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="05 WP Hacked.fw.png" height="215" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/05_WP_Hacked.fw.png" width="190"/></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You can also click the dropdown at the top of the list. Select ‘Update’ from the ‘Bulk Actions’ dropdown, and then click ‘Apply’ to update all plugins in that list.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Updating_plugins_via_SSH">Updating plugins via SSH</span></h3>
<p>You can use the WP CLI interface to update plugins via SSH. View the following page for further details and examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693248-WordPress-wp-cli-overview">WordPress wp-cli</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Disabling_plugins_via_FTP">Disabling plugins via FTP</span></h3>
<p>You can also disable plugins via FTP. These instructions remove the functionality of these plugins from your WordPress install, without removing the plugin files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the example.com/wp-content/plugins directory.</li>
<li>Find the plugin folder you wish to remove.</li>
<li>Rename the plugin folder. For example if the plugin folder is named /myplugin, rename it to /myplugin_OFF. This disables the plugin.</li>
<li>Rename it back whenever you wish to re-enable it.</li>
</ol>
<p>To disable all plugins, just rename the entire /plugins directory to /plugins_OFF. If you rename the plugins directory and then try to install new plugins while the name is changed, you will get an error.</p>
<p>If you want to keep the plugin files in /plugins_OFF and install new plugins, create a new and empty plugins directory at the same time that you rename the old one.</p>

<p>It is best to always remove themes you are not using. You should only keep the theme you actively use since you can always reinstall removed themes at any time. By removing themes, you keep their files from being used as attack entry points.</p>
