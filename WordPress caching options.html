<p>There are several caching plugins available for WordPress sites which can help to improve your website loading time and overall performance. They can also help your site to handle large spikes in traffic like the <a class="new" title="W:Slashdot effect (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">Slashdot effect</a>. Below are some that work the best on DreamHost's servers:</p>
<h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a></h3>
<p>This plugin creates a static file cache of your site and loads that instead of using PHP to generate the page. Picking up where WP-Cache left off, this plugin has included advanced features as well as a plugin and hooks system. It is included with all new deluxe One-Click Installs of WordPress done by DreamHost. If you're on shared hosting, this is the best option. An installation guide can be found here: <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214588698-Installing-WP-Super-Cache">Installing WP Super Cache</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hyper-cache/">Hyper Cache</a></h3>
<p>This is probably one of the most user-friendly caching plugins out there and is an outstanding alternative for most end users.</p>
<h2>VPS servers only</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945977-How-do-I-use-XCache-on-a-private-server-">XCache</a></h3>
<p>Normal VPS users have XCache available in the DreamHost panel which ties in with W3TC. If instead you want to self-install Memcached, try using the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/">Batcache</a> to speed up WP.</p>
<h2>DreamPress only</h2>
<h3>Varnish</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> uses Varnish Caching and Memcached, along with pre-installed plugins that are specifically configured to help WordPress take full advantage of these features. Thanks to this, there is no need for DreamPress users to install caching plugins.</span></p>
<h2>DreamHost's CDN</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215916677-What-is-DreamSpeed-">Setting Up DreamSpeed CDN</a></h3>
<p>Using DreamSpeed, your static content will be cached on the CDN which will ease the load on your account and can speed up your WordPress installation. Once you have signed up for DreamSpeed CDN, you can log into your WordPress dashboard and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dreamspeed-cdn/">enable the plugin</a>.</p>
