<p>DreamHost has an anti-spam feature you can turn on from the panel on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.junk&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Mail' &gt; 'Anti-spam'</a>) page. Enabling the settings there will set up filters which will allow you to block incoming spam.</p>
<h2>How anti-spam filtering works</h2>
<p>The filters scan incoming emails and compare them against a set of rules or characteristics shared by spam emails. For each item matched, that rule's score is added to the email and listed in the message headers as the message’s ‘X-Spam-Score’. If this score is greater than the quarantine value set for that user, the email will be quarantined as junk instead of being delivered to the inbox.</p>
<h2>Enabling anti-spam filtering</h2>
<p>Filtering can be turned on for a domain and all email addresses on that domain in the panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.junk&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Anti-Spam’</a>).</p>
<p>Domains that have a catch-all address or use a non-DreamHost mail service cannot use this filtering. Individual email addresses can have their own settings, but filtering can only be turned on and off completely for an entire domain.</p>
<h2>Accessing quarantined emails</h2>
<p>Emails are quarantined in the special 'Junk Mail' folder by default. This folder is not stored as part of the regular mail account. It can only be accessed from the mailboxes interface and the SquirrelMail Webmail interface.</p>
<p>Read more about the Webmail interface in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216540008">Atmail webmail overview</a> article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webmail is linked in the panel’s Webmail page at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.webmail&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Webmail’</a>).</li>
<li>The mailboxes interface is linked from the panel's (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; Manage Email’</a>) page. It’s shown as a link under the email address as ‘mailbox manager’.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inside the Junk Mail quarantine</h2>
<p>The four columns are <strong>From</strong>, <strong>Subject</strong>, <strong>Score</strong>, and <strong>Date</strong>. Each can be sorted in ascending or descending order using the small up and down black triangle arrows. Use the column of checkboxes on the left to select one or more emails to work with. After the emails are checked, you can use these four buttons above the columns to control what happens to those Junk emails:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Move to Inbox</strong></dt>
<dd>Moves email that are legitimate (not spam) to the Inbox.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Whitelist/Inbox</strong></dt>
<dd>Moves email to the Inbox as well as whitelisting the sender so they are not marked as spam in the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Blacklist/Delete</strong></dt>
<dd>Deletes email and also blacklists the sender address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Delete</strong></dt>
<dd>Deletes the current email.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Emails will be automatically deleted from the Junk Mail quarantine folder after 30 days. It is a good idea to delete spam emails when you see them so that there are less emails in the folder to sort through.</p>
<h2>Setting up alternative filters</h2>
<p>If you do not wish to use the anti-spam filtering feature that DreamHost offers through the panel, you have a few alternatives for filtering incoming mail before it's delivered to your hosted user with DreamHost.</p>
<p>Below is a description of alternative junk-message filters:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Message filters</strong></dt>
<dd>These are available through your account panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.filters&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Message Filters’</a>). This feature allows you to customize and create your own set of filter rules for each user. You can refer to the following article for details with this feature:</dd>

<div class="alert alert-note">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>You cannot set up these custom message filters on a domain-wide basis. They must be created for each user you want them applied to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Third-party filtering providers</h2>
<p>You can set up third-party mail filtering services for your domain as well and have those filtering services deliver the mail to DreamHost mail servers once the filtering is complete. This can be setup through your account panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Custom MX’</a>).</p>
<dl>
