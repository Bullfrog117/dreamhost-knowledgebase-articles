<p>If you already have an existing DreamPress or WordPress site created with the One-Click Installer, you are also able to import content into your DreamPress site.</p>
<h2>Importing to DreamPress as a test environment</h2>

<p>The following instructions help you create a safe copy of your DreamPress site for testing purposes, without affecting your existing one. For example, you can set up a new instance of DreamPress on a different domain and then import your existing DreamPress site to it. Once you're finished testing, delete it to avoid extra costs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can import a current One-Click install into a temporary DreamPress site. This allows you the ability to use the temporary domain as a testing environment before migrating to your actual site URL. View the following articles for details on how to create a DreamPress temporary domain:</p>

<p>If you have no need for the testing environment, just proceed with uploading directly to your actual site URL.</p>
<h2>Importing into DreamPress</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a DreamPress installation.
<dl>
<dd><em>After you create your DreamPress installation, an 'Import' button appears on the DreamPress page: </em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Dreampress_Account_Page.fw.png" alt="01 Dreampress Account Page.fw.png" width="568" height="253" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Import</strong> button beneath the site into which you wish to import content.
<dl>
<dd><em>A window pops up allowing you to select a site from which to import your content:</em></dd>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/02_Dreamp_import_dialog.fw.png" alt="02 Dreamp import dialog.fw.png" width="425" height="206" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Choose the site you'd like to import data from in the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Start Import</strong> button to begin the import process.</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a clone/copy of the One-Click and changes the domain name. This is ideal for testing DreamPress, testing new plugins or themes, and so on, since it leaves the original site intact. It's also good for splitting out a single WordPress installation from a domain that has multiple apps. For example, you can turn example.com/blog into blog.example.com.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you're importing your WordPress install from a different domain name, the import toolÂ will attempt to replace the domain/URLs. If it fails to do so, the email following the import will indicate that. In any case, you should always double check if this data is correct after the import has completed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you wish to migrate a different domain's WordPress content to a domain that you want on DreamPress, then you should add the domain first to DreamPress and then use the Import feature.</p>
