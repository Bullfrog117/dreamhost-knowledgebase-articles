<li><strong>Also forwards to</strong>: This field shows any forwarding aliases you have set up for the email address you’re viewing. If there are no forwarding aliases set up for the email address, it’ll show this message:</li>

<li><strong>Actions</strong>: This column consists of three buttons for each email address: Edit, Disable, and Delete.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>-<strong>Edit</strong>: The edit button takes you to another page where you can make changes to your email address such as increasing the mailbox size.</dd>
<dd>-<strong>Disable</strong>: This button disables the email address within an hour. Clicking this button changes what you see for that user on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Emails’</a>) page by striking a line through the user’s mailbox name and mailbox size as well as setting a new message under the ‘Also forwards to’ column. The new message will read:
<dl>
<dd>“<em>Deleted with bounce.</em>”</dd>
<dd>(What this means is that any email sent to this disabled user will be deleted and rejected back to the sender with a bounce error.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>-<strong>Delete</strong>: Clicking this button deletes the user, but a pop-up window displays prompting you to verify this request first with the this message:
<dl>
<dd>“<em>REALLY DELETE user@example.com AND ALL EMAIL IN ITS MAILBOX PERMANENTLY?!!</em>”</dd>
<dd>Clicking “OK” deletes the user and the mailbox for that user. This requires a few minutes, but once this is done, you no longer see that user listed on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Emails’</a>) page for that domain. This is unlike when you disable the user, which will still keep the user name on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Emails’</a>) page in case you wish to set it up as a hosted email address again in the future.</dd>
