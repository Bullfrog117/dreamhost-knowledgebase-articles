<p>The following sections help you manage various aspects of your private server.</p>
<h2><span id="Accessing_your_server_before_you_move_a_domain">Accessing your server before you move a domain</span></h2>
<p>If you want to access the server to perform configuration before you move your domain over, you can use the following form of a hostname in your FTP client (NOT in http):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>where <strong>psXXXXX</strong> is the hostname of your VPS.</p>
<p>If you enter <strong>ftp://psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong> in a web browser, it would work; but <strong>http://psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong> does not work. This is because http and FTP requests are handled differently: for http requests, the server shares ip addresses among domains, whereas for FTP requests, the server only needs the FTP username/password to know what content is in scope for its response.</p>
<p>In an FTP application, the server name, <strong>psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong>, is adequate as a hostname for the same reasons.</p>
