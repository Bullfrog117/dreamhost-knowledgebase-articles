<p>A <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> address is NOT required to enable Secure Hosting. However, if you plan to use an eCommerce application it's strongly recommend that you add a Unique IP address to provide maximum compatibility with all Internet browsers.</p>
<p>For more information about Unique IP addresses (including instructions for adding one to your domain), take a look at the Unique IP article.</p>
<h2>Free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates</h2>
<p>Let's Encrypt is a new Certificate Authority (CA) that offers <strong>FREE</strong> SSL certificates that are just as secure as current paid certificates. This project was pioneered to make encrypted connections the default standard throughout the Internet.</p>

<h2><span id="Self-signed_vs._professionally-signed_certificate">DreamHost Self-signed vs. professionally-signed certificate</span></h2>
<p>You have the option to create a free self-signed certificate or a paid professionally-signed certificate for your domain. They function the same, but if you choose to use a free self-signed certificate, a warning message appears in the browser when visiting the site.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>The following warning message appears in FireFox when visiting a site using a free self-signed certificate:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="02 Secure Hosting Firefox Warning.fw.png" height="395" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/02_Secure_Hosting_Firefox_Warning.fw.png" width="599"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>Potential customers might be discouraged by a certificate warning/error message and may not wish to do business with your site when they see this. If you intend to do business over the Internet, especially if you're going to handle electronic transactions, then DreamHost strongly recommends that you purchase a signed SSL certificate for your domain.</p>
<p>You can add a self-signed certificate by adding Secure Hosting to your domain on the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Secure Hosting’</a>) page. Once you add it, a FREE private key, Certificate Signing Request (CSR), and self-signed SSL certificate are automatically generated and installed for you when you initially set up your Secure Hosting.</p>
<p>If you’d like to purchase a professionally-signed certificate, view the following article</p>
