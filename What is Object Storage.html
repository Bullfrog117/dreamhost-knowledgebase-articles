<p>An object storage system like DreamObjects is like a bottomless pit
where you can add files in without having to care about filling it up.
DreamObjects is like a file system with infinite capacity. Files are
stored as <cite>objects</cite> into <cite>buckets</cite>. From <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage">Wikipedia Object Storage
page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a storage
architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other
storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a
file hierarchy and block storage which manages data as blocks
within sectors and tracks. Each object typically includes the data
itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique
identifier. [...] Object storage systems allow relatively
inexpensive, scalable and self-healing retention of massive
amounts of unstructured data.</div></blockquote>
<p>DreamObjects can be used is used for diverse purposes such as
storing photos, songs, documents, backups and more without worrying
of filling up a disk.</p>
<p>While DreamObjects may resemble an FTP system, some details are very
different:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>files (<cite>objects</cite>) stored in DreamObjects have a unique identifier in
the form of URI.</li>
<li>objects have metadata attached to describe what the object is, who
created it, who has access to it, for how long and more. These look
like the permissions in the FTP directories but they’re more
powerful and extensible.</li>
<li>there are no real directories in DreamObjects: the <cite>buckets</cite> are
names assigned to a common space and are part of the object’s URI.</li>
<li><cite>access key</cite> and <cite>user key</cite> are used instead of usernames and
passwords. Each user can generate multiple access key and a secret
key is automatically generated for each access key and cannot be
changed. Together access and user keys are called <cite>key pair</cite>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="why-the-bucket-names-have-to-be-unique">
<h2>Why the bucket names have to be unique</h2>
<p>Objects stored DreamObjects are identified by a URL that looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><cite>https://$BUCKET_NAME.objects-us-west-1.dream.io/$OBJECT_NAME</cite></div></blockquote>
<p>Since the bucket name is part of the host name in the URL and host
names must be unique, the bucket name also must be unique. For
example, if a bucket called “my-bucket” would have the URL:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><cite>https://my-bucket.objects-us-west-1.dream.io</cite></div></blockquote>
<p>This means that there can only be <strong>one</strong> bucket called “my-bucket” on
DreamObjects. Therefore, the easiest way to create a new bucket is to
assign a random name and create a domain alias for it using <a class="reference external" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects">DreamHost
Control Panel</a>.</p>
