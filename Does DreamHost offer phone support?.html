<p>Support is mainly provided via email and Live Chat. However, DreamHost does have an option whereby customers can request a callback from technical support.</p>
<p>By default, callbacks are not included with the standard hosting package. You can, however, add three callbacks per month to your account for a nominal monthly fee. Support also offers a one-time callback feature for a fee as well.</p>
