<div id="how-much-do-ip-addresses-cost">
<h2>How much do IP addresses cost?</h2>
<p>In US-East 2 virtual servers receive a public IPv4 and IPv6 address by default.

<div id="how-much-does-extra-block-storage-cost">
<h2>How much does extra block storage cost?</h2>
<p>Each DreamCompute cluster includes 100 GB of block storage at no charge. You

100GB chunks.</p>
<p>Monthly pricing for the 100 GB chunks in US-East 2 is $10.00/month.</p>
<p>Pricing for block storage is based on the total monthly allotment rather than
the amount used.</p>
