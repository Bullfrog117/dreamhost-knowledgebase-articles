<p>In case there are issues with the spam filters set up for your users, there are some basic troubleshooting steps that you can take. Below are some common problems that can occur and what you can do to resolve them.</p>
<h2>Too much spam is still showing up in the Inbox</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try lowering the quarantine score to catch more junk emails.</li>
<li>Set up blacklists for the entire domain instead of just the specific email sending the message. This way you’ll block all emails from that domain.</li>
<li>The anti-spam filter may not catch all of the incoming junk messages due to how the message was sent or created. DreamHost offers the option of setting up custom message filters, and you can refer to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215030678-How-do-I-enable-message-filters-on-my-email-address-">Message Filters</a> article <em>(for advanced users)</em> for further information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emails are not being quarantined</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure filtering is enabled for the domain on the panel's Anti-Spam page.</li>
<li>When enabling the anti-spam filters for a domain, it will change the MX records for the domain’s mail service to the filter records. This will require up to 6 hours to resolve before the anti-spam filters are enabled and properly scoring/quarantining messages. Messages will still be delivered, but will not be scored/quarantined until the DNS resolves.</li>
<li>If the domain is not using DreamHost's nameservers, make sure you manually update your domain's DNS with the new anti-spam filtering MX records.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Email from a whitelisted address is still quarantined</h2>
<p>The email's From address may not match where the email was actually sent from. Try using the Junk Mail folder's 'Whitelist/Inbox' button to whitelist the sender of the quarantined email along with moving the message from the ‘Junk Mail’ folder to the inbox.</p>
<h2>Email sent to multiple DreamHost addresses only received by one email's quarantine</h2>
<p>This is by design. If the original email is quarantined by any recipient, only one copy is stored in that particular Junk Mail folder. No additional copies will be delivered, even to the other recipients that would have not quarantined it.</p>
