<p>JavaScript can add a lot of interactivity and interesting remote content to a site — However, if used liberally, it can also cause pages to load slower. There are a few things you can do to speed up your JavaScript commands.</p>
<h2><span id="Remote_JavaScript" class="mw-headline">Remote JavaScript</span></h2>
<p>Instead of inserting remote JavaScript towards the top of your page — as plenty of instructions for insertion suggest — it is completely acceptable to add it right before the <strong>&lt;/body&gt;</strong> tag in your theme. Due to the way page load order is handled in the browser, this will allow your content to start rendering and display before having to wait for remote files (which would load first if were they in the header).</p>
<p>If you'd like to save yourself from tweaking your themes manually, the <a class="external text" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/footer-javascript/" rel="nofollow">JavaScript to Footer</a> plugin may help quite a bit.</p>
<h2><span id="Local_JavaScript" class="mw-headline">Local JavaScript</span></h2>
<p>Pushing local JavaScript to the bottom of the page will also give the appearance of speeding up load time, so you might want to throw a little edit on your theme to migrate any local JavaScript from <strong>header.php</strong> to <strong>footer.php</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, while mod_deflate should compress JavaScript, you can cut a little bit of overhead off by pre-caching the compression. All you need to do is save gzipped copies of your theme's JavaScript in the same directory as your current files. Again, you'll need to <a class="new" title="SSH (page does not exist)" href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267">SSH</a> in to your web server to do this.</p>
<p>The location of JavaScript varies from theme to theme, but the theme itself can always be found in the "wp-content/themes/" directory. Once you have found the JavaScript for your site, simply run:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">gzip javascript.js</span></pre>
</div>
<p>So long as you replace "javascript.js" with the actual filename you wish to compress and repeat the process for all of your files, a compressed version of your .js files will be created. The benefit to this is that once it's done, you don't have to do anything else.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.objects-us-west-1.dream.io/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Some themes attempt to compress JavaScript and CSS by adding a ".php" to the end of the file name. This actually processes the file through PHP unnecessarily and can cause a significant amount of overhead. If you notice your theme doing this, please modify your theme and use the gzip method discussed above.</p>
