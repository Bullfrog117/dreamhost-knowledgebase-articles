<div id="what-is-let-s-encrypt">
<h2>What is Let’s Encrypt?</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a> is a new certificate
authority that provides absolutely free secure certificates to help
get to 100% HTTPS on the Internet. DreamHost has integrated Let’s
Encrypt support into our panel for hosted services, but if you want
to set up automatically-renewing certificates for domains you host
on a DreamCompute instance, you’ll need to do a little bit of manual
installation. But the good news is, it doesn’t take long, and once
you finish the setup, you should never have to worry about renewing
a certificate ever again!</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-code">
<h2>Get the code</h2>
<p>You’ll need to SSH to your DreamCompute instance. It shouldn’t matter
too much which distribution of Linux you’re running, but make sure
you have the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></code> package installed so that you can clone the
letsencrypt repository, like so:</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo -s
cd /opt
git clone git://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="get-your-first-certificate">
<h2>Get your first certificate</h2>
<p>Before you do this, you’ll need to make sure that your domain is
actually pointing at your DreamCompute instance’s IP address, and
that your webserver is configured to respond to requests for your
domain name. Let’s Encrypt performs checks to make sure that you
control domain names that you request certificates for.</p>
<p>But, let’s say that you have <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example.com</span></code> configured with a DNS
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></code> record pointing at the IP address for your instance, and you
have <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apache</span></code> already configured properly to respond
to requests for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example.com</span></code>. (Configuring your webserver is kind
of out of the scope of this guide, but there are <a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/">plenty of tutorials</a> out there.)</p>
<p>These sample snippets assume that the webserver is configured to
serve files for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example.com</span></code> from the location <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/srv/example.com</span></code>
on your instance. Make sure to update that location to match your
domain’s document root!</p>
<p>If you’re using Apache on a Debian or Ubuntu instance, you can
use the Apache plugin for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">letsencrypt-auto</span></code> like so:</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cd /opt/letsencrypt
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will prompt you for some information including
your email address. Fill it in with valid information and you
should get a shiny new certificate! You shouldn’t even
need to restart their web server or modify a configuration file,
as the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apache</span></code> plugin for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">letsencrypt-auto</span></code> handles that for
you.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-a-subdomain-to-an-existing-certificate">
<h2>Adding a subdomain to an existing certificate</h2>
<p>If you just realized that you also need a certificate for a subdomain,
don’t worry! You can add a new subdomain to your existing cert at any
time, by simply calling <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">letsencrypt-auto</span></code> again like so...</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cd /opt/letsencrypt
./letsencrypt-auto --apache -d example.com -d sub.example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="automatic-renewal">
<h2>Automatic renewal</h2>
<p>Now, the best part about using Let’s Encrypt (well, aside from the free
certificates): You can have your system automatically renew all of the
certificates for you. I wrote a small shell script I called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/update_certs</span></code> which looks like this:</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#!/bin/bash

/opt/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto renew
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cron</span></code>, I have this scheduled like so:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>30 0 * 0 * /usr/local/bin/update_certs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now, my system attempts to renew all of my certificates once a week.
If there are no certificates in danger of expiring soon, nothing bad
happens, but if they would otherwise expire, then they get renewed and
I don’t have to think about it.</p>
