<div id="what-is-dreamcompute">

<p>DreamHost’s DreamCompute is a cloud computing service that provides scalable
compute resources for developers and entrepreneurs. DreamCompute is based on
OpenStack and designed for scalability, resiliency, and security.</p>
<p>With DreamCompute you can select the amount of compute resources and storage
resources needed and define your own virtual networks.</p>

<h2>Service Highlights</h2>
<div id="openstack">
<h3>OpenStack</h3>
<p>DreamCompute is powered by OpenStack which is a widely adopted, open source
cloud computing platform. It is used by both public cloud hosting companies,
like DreamHost, and for private internal clouds as well.</p>

<div id="compute">
<h3>Compute</h3>
<p>DreamCompute provides virtual servers through the use of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM hypervisor</a>. Virtual machines (VMs) can be
started by creating an Instance using the DreamCompute dashboard. Each instance
is based on a Flavor. Flavors define the amount of resources allocated to the
VM in terms of vCPUs, memory, and boot volume size. DreamCompute provides
Flavors small enough for companies just starting out to large ones for
companies with greater computing needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="network">
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>Networking services for DreamCompute are delivered through OpenStack’s
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Neutron">Neutron service</a>, coupled with
DreamHost’s own <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/astara">Akanda</a> project which
has been picked up by OpenStack and renamed Astara.</p>
<p>Another component to DreamCompute networking is the open source Akanda project
developed by DreamHost. Akanda serves as a network traffic router (OSI Layer 3)
for virtual networks created in DreamCompute. Akanda allows virtual networks to
be configured to talk to each other, to LANs, to WANs or to the Internet.</p>
<p>The combination of Neutron, and Akanda bring a level of network flexibility
and security that sets DreamCompute apart from the competition.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage">
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Storage in DreamCompute is implemented with <a class="reference external" href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>. Ceph
is a massively scalable, distributed, redundant storage technology that can
be delivered using standard server hardware. OpenStack’s
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Cinder">Cinder</a> project integrates with Ceph for
block storage using Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) software.</p>
<p>Ceph is software created by DreamHost founder Sage Weil and has been under
development inside DreamHost for several years. Ceph has been open source
since its inception, and in early 2012, a new company called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.inktank.com/">Inktank</a> was spun out of DreamHost to support and continue
development of the technology. Inktank was then acquired by Red Hat in April
2014.</p>
<p>Ceph is also the foundation for DreamHost’s cloud storage service
<a class="reference external" href="https://dreamhost.com/cloud/storage">DreamObjects</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="dashboard">
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>The DreamCompute dashboard is built with OpenStack’s
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Horizon">Horizon</a> project. The dashboard provides a
user interface for interacting with DreamCompute’s three main services:
Compute, Networking, and Storage.  Functions such as launching an instance,
creating storage volumes, and configuring a virtual network, as well as
creating and managing snapshots of both a running instance and storage volumes,
can all be done in the dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div id="automation-apis">
<h3>Automation APIs</h3>
<p>OpenStack, and therefore DreamCompute, has a whole host of APIs that can be
used for system automation. More about OpenStack APIs can be found here:

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div id="how-do-i-sign-up">
<h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
<p>If you’ve already got a DreamHost account then you can sign up from your
<a class="reference external" href="http://panel.dreamhost.com/dreamcompute">Control Panel</a>. If not, sign up
from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/dreamcompute">DreamCompute page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-pricing-plans">
<h3>What are the pricing plans?</h3>
<p>A simple pricing plan: you only pay for what you use, with a maximum monthly
expense. No more confusing invoices or bills, and no surprise at the end of
the month. For example, if all you need is a lightspeed size machine (1 CPU,
1GB RAM) for 5 hours a month, you’ll pay 5 cents. If you use that for more
than 25 days in a month, you’ll only pay a maximum of $6.</p>
<p>With any of our DreamCompute plans, you can easily create virtual machines,
block devices and networks using the DreamCompute Dashboard, or via OpenStack
APIs and command-line tools.</p>

</div>
<div id="where-are-the-data-centers-located">
<h3>Where are the data centers located?</h3>
<p>DreamHost cloud services are currently located in the United States, but
accessible from anywhere globally.  DreamCompute is located in our
Ashburn, Virginia (US-East) data center, and DreamObjects is located in our
Irvine, California (US-West) data center.</p>
</div>
<div id="will-dreamcompute-scale">
<h3>Will DreamCompute scale?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can scale your apps both vertically and horizontally, by creating VMs
with additional resources, or by spinning up additional VMs to handle similar
or diverse infrastructure workloads (e.g. creating multiple load balancers, or
separating web servers and databases). The unique networking features in
DreamCompute enable developers and operations teams to design sophisticated
n-tier architectures, with many VMs.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-i-scale-my-disk-volume-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my disk volume on a running instance?</h3>
<p>You can scale your disk volumes that are in use if you use
<a class="reference external" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/">LVM</a> (Logical Volume Manager). We recommend
using LVM when mounting your disk volumes for this reason. LVM allows you to
continually add more disk space without any service interruption.  If you don’t
use LVM you would need to mount another (larger) volume, then copy your data
from the old to the new volume.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-i-scale-my-cpu-or-memory-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my CPU or memory on a running instance?</h3>
<p>If you wish to add more memory or vCPU capacity to an instance, you will need
to start a new larger instance.  First, take a snapshot of your current
instance, then start a new larger instance based on that snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-my-data-backed-up">
<h3>Is my data backed up?</h3>
<p>DreamCompute block storage is based on Ceph which is highly scalable,
redundant, and self-healing storage technology. Ceph is designed to deliver
extreme durability of data, by creating and managing replicas of your data that
are intelligently distributed across zones in our data centers. The system
automatically detects potential corruption of data or potential failure or
degradation of any storage node, and immediately creates new replicas from
redundant data copies, delivering enterprise-grade durability. During the Beta
period, we recommend that you take a regular snapshot of your disk volume as a
back up, which can be stored locally.</p>
