<li>Scroll down on the ‘Manage Domain’ page that appears to view all non-editable DreamHost DNS records and also any custom DNS records that you may have created.</li>
<li>Copy all the DNS records in case your new hosting company requires you to replicate them on their servers.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pointing_your_DNS_to_the_new_hosting_company">Pointing your DNS to the new hosting company</span></h2>
<p>Before you point your DNS to the new hosting company, make sure you have backed up the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web files via FTP</li>
<li>Database via phpMyAdmin or Command Line</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>Copy of the DNS records</li>
</ul>
<p>To change your DNS to point to your new host:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, go to the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the ‘DNS’ link under your domain.</li>
<li>On the next page, locate the section titled ‘Change example.tld whois nameservers’.</li>
<li>Remove the DreamHost nameservers and replace them with the new hosting company’s nameservers.
<ul>
<li>If you are not sure of the nameservers to set for your domain, you may need to contact your new hosting provider to determine what nameservers your domain must use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
