<h2>What is git?</h2>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">git</a> is a version control system. A version control system is software that allows developers to maintain a full history of every file in a project. However, you don't need to be a developer to use git with your website. For example, you can use git by yourself to maintain a history of all of your website files. In this way, every time a file is changed, a version of that is recorded in the git software. If necessary, you can always go back to any version and restore it.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to say that git is just backup software. This would be incorrect as git does much more than backup your files. git does indeed store a full history of your files, but it stores the 'version' of those files throughout a history. This allows git to retrieve information on when a file was edited and exactly what about the file changed. A simple backup does not have this capability.</p>

<h2>Do I need to use git?</h2>
<p>No, but it is recommended if you're often making changes to the code in your website. For example, if you're updating the code of your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, or any other files that create your website, it's recommended you keep backups of those files in case a change you made caused an error on your site.</p>
<p>With a simple backup, you would have the old files you could restore. But with git, you can see a full history of not only when a file was edited, but exactly what about that file was changed. This can help you to troubleshoot coding issues with your site.</p>
