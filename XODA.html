<p>XODA is a DMS (Document Management System) based on Ajax. XODA is targeted towards end users who want to organize various types of documents on a remote machine running a UNIX-like Operating System with web server and PHP support. It is a lightweight web application (just a few files) and stores the "meta-information" in PHP files which allows simple functionality on the command line without collisions.</p>
