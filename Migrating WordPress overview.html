<p>Migrating a WordPress site is different from migrating a simple HTML website because WordPress sites depend on both web files as well as a MySQL database to run. If you are new to the process of moving a WordPress site from one host to another, this overview explains your options depending on the type of migration you need.</p>
<h2>Migrating a WordPress site from a different host</h2>
<p>If you are migrating a WordPress site from a different hosting company (host), there are many different options available to you. Here are some of the more popular methods from which you can choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693178-How-to-manually-migrate-WordPress-to-DreamHost">Migrating your site manually using FTP and phpMyAdmin</a></li>
<li>Migrating your site using a third-party WordPress plugin, such as <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215412197-Migrating-WordPress-to-DreamHost-using-the-Duplicator-plugin">Duplicator</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#paid">Requesting DreamHost Professional Services to migrate your site for a fee</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each method’s steps may change depending on whether you are keeping the same domain name (aka your URL) or you are changing to a new one.</p>
<h3>Keeping the same domain name</h3>
<p>If you are keeping the same domain name and you want to minimize downtime on the current site while you are migrating, you might benefit from setting up a mirror of your DreamHost site using a temporary .dreamhosters.com subdomain:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Viewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">Access your site using a free dreamhosters.com subdomain</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the domain name</h3>
<p>If you are changing your WordPress site to a new domain name when you move to DreamHost, many plugins help you make that change automatically, though each plugin handles it in its own way. However, if you are migrating manually using FTP and phpMyAdmin, you must manually update your migrated site to the new domain name. After you complete the five steps in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693178-How-to-manually-migrate-WordPress-to-DreamHost">Migrating Manually instructions</a>, the following guide’s steps 5 through 7 help you rename your WordPress site manually:</p>

<h2>Migrating a WordPress site between domains on your DreamHost account</h2>
<p>If you wish to keep a WordPress site’s content but change its domain name to a new one, not only will you need to make changes in your DreamHost account, you must also make changes in your WP Admin Dashboard. The following guide explains one method to make sure your content fully changes to the new domain name:</p>

</ul>
<h3>DreamPress option to migrate your site to a new domain</h3>
<p>If you are having trouble migrating a WordPress site using the above instructions or you would like a quicker way, you can upgrade your new domain to DreamPress, which offers an Import option. <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> is DreamHost's Managed WordPress hosting. It's a scalable service that allows users to manage their WordPress sites with simple pricing and added benefits of server robustness, caching, and memory.</p>
<p>If your current WordPress site was installed and managed by DreamHost's One-Click Installer, you can set up DreamPress on the new domain name and import the content of the current WordPress site into the new DreamPress domain. You can add DreamPress on a new domain on your DreamHost panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘DreamPress’ &gt; ‘Dashboard’</a>). Please see the following guide for how to import content in DreamPress:</p>

</ul>
<p>If your current WordPress site is not managed by our One-Click Installer, you can <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=support.msg">submit a ticket</a> to request your site converted to a One-Click Install. You will need to approve the few minutes of unavoidable downtime on your current site while this conversion occurs.</p>
