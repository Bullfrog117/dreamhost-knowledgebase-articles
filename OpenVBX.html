<p>PHP 5.5 will soon be removed from DreamHost as it has been <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php">EOLd by php.net</a>. This application should be updated immediately to the latest One-Click version to prevent any issues after the PHP version is updated to 5.6. If the version is not updated, it's possible the site will not function properly.</p>

<p>OpenVBX is a web-based open source phone system for business. It can be configured to generate virtual phone numbers and provide each user with their own phone number and personal conference line. Users of OpenVBX have the ability to dial whole departments and also share voicemail messages with their team. OpenVBX comes with applets for auto-attendants, call forwarding, voicemails (with transcription), receiving text messages and more. It is possible to integrate OpenVBX with your existing system as well as build your own custom phone applets with just a little bit of PHP knowledge. You can also build business applications with the easy drag 'n drop editor. Since OpenVBX is open source, you will have the ability to modify it and make it your own. You can also rebrand and resell OpenVBX to your customers.</p>
