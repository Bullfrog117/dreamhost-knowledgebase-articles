<p>YubiKey was chosen because it's a small, low cost, and a durable USB hardware device with open source customization support for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Many companies and governments, including Google and the US Department of Defense, use YubiKey as an industry security standard for 2nd layer verification. <a class="external text" href="https://www.yubico.com/" rel="nofollow">Yubico</a> hardware engineering and manufacturing is only conducted in the USA and Sweden to prevent device cloning and to mitigate the risk of exposure of its confidential design. In addition to using YubiKey with your DreamHost panel, it can also be used for securing access to a wide range of <a class="external text" href="https://www.yubico.com/applications/" rel="nofollow">applications</a>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote access</li>
<li>VPN</li>
<li>Password managers</li>
<li>Computer login</li>
<li>CMS and popular online services</li>
</ul>
<p>Most third party support for Google Authenticator is also supported for YubiKey. YubiKey is the affordable, hardware-based alternative to having a mobile phone/tablet with an Internet connection. For example, YubiKey would be useful for remote locations where cellular service/Internet is not available (network admins in a basement, government employees, etc). As of 2015, YubiKey has a few product versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard model (estimated price $25)</li>
<li>Small usb form factor (Model: Nano $40)</li>
<li>NFC wireless technology (Model: Neo $50)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these products can be purchased at the <a class="external text" href="https://store.yubico.com/store/catalog/index.php" rel="nofollow">Yubico store</a>.</p>
