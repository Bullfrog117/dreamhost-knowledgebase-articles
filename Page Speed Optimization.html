<p>As of September 15, 2015, Page Speed Optimization has been removed from the DreamHost Panel. It can manually be installed on a Dedicated server, but is no longer supported by DreamHost.</p>
<p>It is not available for use on a VPS as sudo/admin/root access is not available.</p>

<p>Page Speed Optimization is a feature that reduces website loading times by automatically optimizing web pages and the resources within them. Under the hood of this feature is an Apache module that Google developed called <a class="external text" href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/module.html" rel="nofollow">mod_pagespeed</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_it_work.3F" class="mw-headline">How does it work?</span></h2>
<p>Page Speed Optimization dynamically adjusts the filenames of site resources, adding information about how 'old' the item is. It uses these age calculations to instruct visitor's browsers to serve cached copies of resources instead of requesting new copies. This cuts down on the number of requests to the server, which improves site speed in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a visitor can use a cached version of a resource instead of requesting a new copy, there is no need for the visitor to wait for the request to be sent to the server and then wait for the server to send the resource back to their browser.</li>
<li>with the server serving less resource requests, it has more resources to jump on the requests it does receive, so those requests can potentially be filled in less time.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_tell_if_it.27s_working.3F" class="mw-headline">How can I tell if it's working?</span></h2>
<p>Once you have manually installed Page Speed Optimization, go to your website and browse around a bit. Resources that are on multiple web pages, such as a header graphic, have a filename like <code>originalFileName.gif.pagespeed.ce.9-w9vHbyfP.gif</code>. The <code>originalFileName.gif</code> is what you named it when you uploaded it to the web server. All the extra stuff (<code>.pagespeed.ce.9-w9vHbyfP.gif</code>) is added by Page Speed Optimization.</p>
<h2><span id="What_if_my_page_images_get_rewritten.3F" class="mw-headline">What if my page images get rewritten?</span></h2>
<p>If an image with a name like "Åsen.jpg" gets rewritten by Page Speed Optimization (note the special character), try renaming it to "Aasen.jpg".</p>
<h2><span id="How_long_does_it_take_for_my_edits_to_update.3F" class="mw-headline">How long does it take for my edits to update?</span></h2>
<p>If you've made edits to your site when Page Speed Optimization is active, you may not see these updates until 5 to 10 minutes later. DreamHost recommends that you disable this feature when updating a live site. This way your changes appear immediately. Once complete, you can then re-enable.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_clear_the_PageSpeed_cache.3F" class="mw-headline">How can I clear the PageSpeed cache?</span></h2>
<p>If you have a Dedicated server, and you are an admin user, you can run:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">sudo touch /var/mod_pagespeed/cache.flush</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Page Speed Optimization has a lot of additional filters which you can use to minify even further by means of custom code in an .htaccess file. You can read more about these filters on Google's site here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external free" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule pagespeed_module&gt;
    ModPagespeed on
    ModPagespeedEnableFilters remove_comments,rewrite_javascript,rewrite_css,rewrite_images
    ModPagespeedEnableFilters elide_attributes,defer_javascript,move_css_to_head
    ModPagespeedJpegRecompressionQuality -1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Below is further information about the filters used in the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-comment-remove" rel="nofollow">remove_comments</a> – removes HTML comments (low risk)</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-js-minify" rel="nofollow">rewrite_javascript</a> – minifies JS (med. to high risk, depending on your site)</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-css-rewrite" rel="nofollow">rewrite_css</a> – parses linked and inline CSS, rewrites the images found, and minifies the CSS (med. risk)</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-image-optimize" rel="nofollow">rewrite_images</a> – compresses and optimizes images (med. risk)</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-attribute-elide" rel="nofollow">elide_attributes</a> – removes attributes from tags (med. risk)</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-css-to-head" rel="nofollow">move_css_to_head</a> – combines CSS and moves it to the head of your file (low risk)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you add multiple options, they can be on one line separated by commas. But <em>do not</em> use spaces. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ModPagespeedEnableFilters remove_comments,move_css_to_head</pre>
</div>
<h2><span id="Using Page Speed with WordPress" class="mw-headline">Using Page Speed with WordPress</span></h2>
<h3>Using PageSpeed with WP Super Cache</h3>
<p>WP Super Cache works excellently with Google PageSpeed. If you're using Google PageSpeed, you don't need to use a minification plugin as you can use PageSpeed to do that instead.</p>
<h3>General WordPress optimization</h3>
<p>Unless you're using nginx, you can use Google PageSpeed on your site to help optimize it further. Just by turning it on, it minifies your webpage. That means it takes your formatted source code and gets rid of the extra spaces you don’t use. This is called by using the PageSpeed filter “collapse_whitespace”.</p>
<p>There are many filters you can add to your site by editing your .htaccess file. You simply need to include a section like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule pagespeed_module&gt;
     ModPagespeed on
     ModPagespeedEnableFilters remove_comments,rewrite_javascript,rewrite_css,rewrite_images
     ModPagespeedEnableFilters elide_attributes,defer_javascript,move_css_to_head
     ModPagespeedJpegRecompressionQuality -1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>
</div>
