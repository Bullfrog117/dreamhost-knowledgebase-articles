<p>It's extremely important to create daily backups of your website data. If your site was ever hacked, or an update to website software broke the site, a backup allows you to immediately restore the site to a previous and functional version.</p>
<p>DreamHost now offers 'Site Saver', a Cloud backup tool available within your panel. This allows your website data to be backed up on DreamHost's cloud servers so you always have a safe offsite backup of your data in case anything happens to your site.</p>
<h2>Enabling 'Site Saver' in the panel</h2>

<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.backups&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Cloud Services' &gt; 'Site Saver')</a> page.
