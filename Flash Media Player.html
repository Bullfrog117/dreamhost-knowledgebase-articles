<p>DreamHost has licensed Jeroen Wijering's excellent <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Media_Player">Flash Media Player</a>. This tool enables all DreamHost customers to embed streamed audio and video into any of their web pages.</p>
<p>The Flash Media Player supports playback of a single media file of any format the Adobe Flash Player can handle (MP3,FLV,SWF,JPG,PNG or GIF). It also supports RSS/XSPF playlist (with mixed mediatypes), a wide range of flashvars (settings) for tweaking both behavior and appearance and an extensive, documented javascript/actionscript API.</p>
<h2><span id="Version">Version</span></h2>
<p>The current version number installed at DreamHost is shown at <a href="https://media.dreamhost.com/">https://media.dreamhost.com/</a> (right-click the player for the full version string). The most recent version can be found at <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Media_Player">the author's site</a> and installing it on your site is very easy.</p>
<h2><span id="Converting_your_video_in_the_panel">Converting your video in the panel</span></h2>
<p>The Flash Media Player can only play videos in "FLV" format. If you need to convert your video, you can use the tool in your DreamHost panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=goodies.media">Goodies (Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'Flash Media'</a>)

</dl>
</li>
<li>You have two options on this page:
<ul>
<li>Convert one file</li>
<li>Convert a whole directory of files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose your domain and the file that is already uploaded into its directory.</li>
<li>You can then choose the dimensions and quality settings.</li>
<li>Click <strong>I'm done uploading, convert this file now...</strong>.</li>
<li>Once complete you are emailed from support@dreamhost.com notifying you that the file is converted and its new location.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DreamHost Flash Video Converter will have saved a copy of your video into an .FLV format in the same directory as your original with a similar filename. After the encoding is complete, you may delete the original video from your webspace.</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_the_flv_video_to_your_site">Adding the flv video to your site</span></h2>
<p>The email you receive after the file conversion contains a few lines of code. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;div id="v72435"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"&gt;Get the Flash Player&lt;/a&gt; to see this video.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://media.dreamhost.com/mp5/jwplayer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
jwplayer("v72435").setup({
	'flashplayer': 'https://media.dreamhost.com/mp5/player.swf',
	'width': 480,
	'height': 360,
	'file': 'http://example.com/filename_480x360.flv',
	'image': 'http://example.com/filename_480x360.jpeg'
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can add this code to an HTML file to display your .flv video.</p>
