<p>DreamHost’s Apache web servers are configured in process-based mode. This means that each process serves one simultaneous connection and uses a significant amount of memory for that, thus limiting concurrent user count. DreamHost offers the option to change your web server to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216431827-Nginx-overview">Nginx</a> within the panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘VPS’ &gt; ‘Dashboard’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Configure</strong> button to the right of your VPS.</li>
<li>Select a server from the ‘HTTP Server’ drop down menu:
<ul>
<li>Apache</li>
<li>nginx</li>
<li>No web server</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Nginx servers use async i/o and can handle large count of concurrent connections without consuming much RAM, especially when serving static files.</li>
<li>Most of the time, Apache is more than sufficient but if your site is receiving very heavy traffic, you may wish to look into nginx.</li>
