<p>When a domain expires, most TLDs allow a 30-day renewal grace period where you can renew the domain at the standard cost. Once that grace period expires, the domain is placed into another 30-day period called redemption with the current registrar that issued DreamHost the license for the domain.</p>
<p>The redemption period, for most TLDs, lasts another 30 days. During this time, you have one more chance to redeem the domain name, but this will cost an additional fee to the registrar to process the redemption.</p>
<p>If you would still like to retrieve the domain in this stage, the registrar charges $100.00 to redeem it. Then, you'll need to pay for the standard yearly registration cost.</p>
<p>To redeem a domain name during the redemption period, click the <strong>‘Redeem this domain!’</strong> button through the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page on your account panel. This prompts you to pay for the redemption cost at $100 before you can complete this process.</p>
<p>The redemption needs some time to process. Please allow up to 30 minutes and if the domain is not redeemed and renewed at that time, feel free to contact DreamHost support for assistance in your panel at (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Support’ &gt; ‘Contact Support’</a>).</p>
