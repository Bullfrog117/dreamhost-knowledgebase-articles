<p>DreamHost does not allow persistent processes to be ran on <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">shared servers</a>. Persistent processes are defined as any UNIX user's command running non-interactively. Basically, something that runs while you aren't actively sitting there interacting with it through a shell window.</p>
<h2><span id="Consequences_on_shared_servers">Consequences on shared servers</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost reserves the right to kill any user process on a shared server without warning or prior notification at the discretion of support or the administrators. This is done to protect other users and maintain the integrity of the shared server.</p>
<p>This is not just done capriciously, however. This is generally done when a process is, in any way, adversely affecting the functionality of a shared server.</p>

<p>The same policies do not apply to <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> and <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> servers. These types of servers can run whatever (LEGAL) processes you like. However, the owner must realize they then accept responsibility for any negative impact this may have on their machine.</p>
