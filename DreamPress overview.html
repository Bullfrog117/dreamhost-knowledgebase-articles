<p>DreamPress is DreamHost's managed <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215525287-WordPress-overview">WordPress</a> hosting. It's a scalable service that allows users to manage their WordPress sites with simple pricing, added benefits of server robustness, caching, and memory.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, it ties together different pieces of DreamHost's existing technology into a cohesive single unit. Below are all the details of this new service.</p>
<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>Each DreamPress instance is made up of <strong>two</strong> VPS instances: one web, and one MySQL.</p>
<p>The two VPS instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>are provisioned automatically</li>
<li>are configured as a pair</li>
<li>are hosted on isolated clusters of hardware so other sites won't interfere with their stability or performance. All of them are hosted in the Virginia datacenter as of June 2013.</li>
<li>disallow root and sudo access</li>
<li>auto-scale RAM (memory) dynamically (customers cannot modify the RAM allocation)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the standard VPS setup, DreamHost added <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> as a caching layer, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is set up automatically for the DreamPress customer</li>
<li>listens on port 80</li>
<li>responds to web requests as a proxy in front of the Apache and PHP WordPress stack</li>
<li>is extremely efficient at caching content</li>
<li>allows this set up to scale to very high levels of traffic</li>
<li>comes with a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Apache runs on port 81 and is still publicly accessible.</p>

<h2>DreamPress 2</h2>
<p>DreamPress 2 is the latest version of DreamHost’s managed WordPress Hosting service. The main difference between DreamPress 2 and DreamPress 1 is speed. Unlike DreamPress 1, all sites on DreamPress 2 are hosted on SSD drives and support PHP 5.5 with OPcache. DreamPress 2 also supports <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215302817-Hip-Hop-Virtual-Machine-HHVM-">HHVM</a> (Hip Hop Virtual Machine), Facebook’s faster replacement for PHP. HHVM is a beta feature on DreamPress 2 and can be enabled in your control panel. What does all this mean? DreamPress 2 outruns DreamPress 1 by a mile.</p>
<h2>Service restrictions</h2>
<p>DreamPress is a managed service, which means DreamHost has restricted certain actions that users can take that would irreparably break their WordPress site.</p>
<p>DreamPress is a one-site service in that a single plan covers a single domain with a single WordPress installation. However, users can have multiple DreamPress instances for multiple sites, and they can mix and match it with shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting as well.</p>
<h3>Current restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unable to configure or modify the VPS instances.</li>
<li>Unable to manually set memory on the VPS. The memory is configured and scales automatically.</li>
<li>No admin users or root SSH keys on the VPS instances.</li>
<li>Unable to add or remove users or domains on the VPS. One SFTP (optional SSH) user and the domain you choose will be configured automatically.</li>
<li>Unable to add or remove databases or hostnames on the MySQL VPS. The database and hostname will be created automatically for WordPress.</li>
<li>Unable to merge databases to or from the MySQL VPS</li>
<li>Unable to delete the web or MySQL VPS instances independently. To delete the VPS instances, go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.wordpress&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘DreamPress’</a>) page and click on the <strong>Downgrade</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> buttons.</li>
<li>Unable to add Wildcard DNS as DreamPress does not utilize a standard DreamHost VPS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if it's not listed as a restriction above, it's still doable. Adding an SSL can be done on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</p>
<h2>User support</h2>
<p>DreamPress comes with support from some of DreamHost’s top tech support, who also have experience in WordPress. After intensive training and evaluation by in-house WordPress core contributors, they were selected as the best-in-class to represent DreamHost and WordPress, and help you with any problems with your DreamPress site. If they don’t know the answer, they know how to find someone who does.</p>
<p>All that said, please note that DreamHost support is <em>not</em> a replacement for an actual website developer (should you need one); DreamHost can help install/configure plugins, but <strong>cannot</strong> make custom plugins or themes for you. Also if a plugin or theme is causing problems, the only support DreamHost may be able to provide is disabling the plugin/theme and suggesting alternatives.</p>
