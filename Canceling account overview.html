<p>DreamHost allows its users to close a shared hosting account using the DreamHost panel. This article details how to close your shared hosting account, a VPS-only account, as well as a Dedicated-only account.</p>
<h2>Do I get my money back if I cancel my account?</h2>
<p>DreamHost prorates the user’s account for any remaining time that has been paid. DreamHost cannot refund money beyond the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">97-Day Money-Back Guarantee</a>.</p>
<p>Please note the following limitations on this refund policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refunds within the 97-Day Money-Back Guarantee can only be processed for shared hosting, per the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
<li>Domain registration fees are not refundable.</li>
<li>VPS and Dedicated plans are also not refundable.</li>
<li>Payments made via check/money order cannot be refunded once cleared.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to cancel your account, you retain ownership of any domain names that you have purchased. If, in the future, you would like to have your domain point to a different web host, you will be able to log in to the <a href="http://panel.dreamhost.com">DreamHost panel</a>, and make your change there to manage your registrations and free DNS services.</p>
<h2>Do I get my money back If DreamHost cancels my account?</h2>
<p>If DreamHost abruptly disables a user’s account due to a breach of the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, then the user forfeits any eligibility for a refund.</p>
