<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article describes how to create a temporary DreamPress domain at DreamHost for your WordPress site hosted at another company.</p>
<p>Most often, you won't change your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> at the other hosting company until your DreamPress site is completely configured first at DreamHost. Otherwise, your site will go down when you update the DNS.</p>
<p>You can now use a 'dream.press' subdomain to create your site at DreamHost. Then when you're ready, you can easily switch your DNS to DreamHost to have it hosted on DreamPress.</p>
<h2>Why use a dream.press subdomain?</h2>
<p>Creating a dream.press subdomainÂ allows you to migrate your entire website to DreamHost and ensure it's functioning properly first. You can then update the DNS to point to DreamHost, which avoids any downtime when changing your DNS.</p>
