<ul>
<li><strong>Conueries</strong> is a term used by DreamHost to measure MySQL database usage. The word is a combination of "connections" and "queries." which is the number of MySQL queries you have in a month, plus 25 times the number of connections you have is your total "conueries" for a month.</li>
<li>DreamHost does not impose any hard limits of conueries on its plans.</li>
<li>DreamHost reserves the right to make high-volume users curtail their database usage (or switch to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">DreamHost PS MySQL</a>). This only applies to very high-volume customers who may be receiving thousands of database-driven visitors each day.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="MySQL_limitations_due_to_shared_hosting">MySQL limitations due to shared hosting</span></h2>
<p>On DreamHost shared accounts, some of the SQL commands listed in the MySQL documentation link below or in references such as the O'Reilly book <em>Managing &amp; Using MySQL</em> by Reese, et al., are not available for scripting nor in phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>Their functionality is available instead through the DreamHost control panel. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215035918-Additional-MySQL-resource-information">Additional MySQL resource information</a> article for further details.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CREATE DATABASE: only works from the shell if you previously created a database with the specified same name using your DreamHost Panel and then dropped it at some point. You should use --drop-database with mysqldump when backing up a database.</li>
<li>GRANT</li>
<li>REVOKE</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table summarizes the privileges a MySQL user at DreamHost may have, as compared to all available privileges.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="If_you_want_to_delete_or_drop_a_database">If you want to delete or drop a database</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can delete a database created on DreamHost through the panel (<strong>Control Panel &gt; Goodies &gt; MySQL Databases</strong>).</li>
<li>Deleted Databases are moved to the recycle bin shown on the same page, and are permanently deleted after 30 days. This allows for easy restoration of databases that are mistakenly deleted.</li>
<li>If you wish to permanently delete a database, you can log into MySQL using the command and issue a "drop database" statement to expedite the process.</li>
