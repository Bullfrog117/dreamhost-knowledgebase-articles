<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_consideration_of_the_email_quota_limit">General consideration of the email quota limit</span></h2>
<p>Whenever you create a new email user account, you’re given the option to limit the total disk usage. By default, this is set to 200MB. DreamHost recommends that if you do set a limit, raise that number if you're expecting to store/save a lot of mail through that new email address and leave it on DreamHost's servers (as opposed to downloading it off the server using a POP3 connection).</p>
<p>Total disk usage of 200 MB is usually a good amount for regular mail, but when it comes to HTML mail and attachments, you'll quickly reach that limit which causes errors until it's changed. If you set a limit and then later you need to change it or remove it entirely, you can do so by editing the email address on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; 'Mail' &gt; 'Manage Email'</a>) page.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>DreamHost recommends that you never set an email account with a disk limit below 100MB as most email clients require some free space in order to operate (even to delete messages). If an email account reaches/exceeds its disk limit, it displays errors and bounce incoming messages. If that happens, you'll need to increase/remove the disk limit in order to get it working again. However, DreamHost also does not not recommended storing over 1000MB of mail as this could cause connection failures in Webmail when attempting to load your Inbox.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>DreamHost mail servers allow incoming messages as large as 40MB, and a couple of large messages can easily fill your account very quickly if its has a very low disk limit. For more information on incoming message limitations, see the following article:</p>

<p>When changing/removing disk limits (quotas), it can sometimes take several hours for the changes to be pushed to the live servers.</p>

<p>If your account reaches/exceeds its disk limit, and you've made a change via the panel, you may want to contact support through a ticket or by starting a “Chat Live” session (using the “Chat Live” button on any page of the panel) and request if support can expedite the change for you.</p>
