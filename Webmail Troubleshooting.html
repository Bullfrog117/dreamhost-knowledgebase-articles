<h2><span id="ERROR:_Could_not_complete_request._Query:_CREATE_.22Sent_Items.22" class="mw-headline">ERROR: Could not complete request. Query: CREATE "Sent Items"</span></h2>
<p>If this error message fills your entire folder column in SquirrelMail, you probably have set two conflicting options. The conflicting options which cause this error are located in the Folder Display options page and the options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent Folder : [Do Not Use]</li>
<li>Show Variable Sent Folder : Always</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix, select "sent folder" to use, or disable the Show Variable Sent Folder.</p>
<h2><span id="Why_doesn.27t_Addressbook_CSV_import_work.3F" class="mw-headline">Why doesn't Addressbook CSV import work?</span></h2>
<p>If you can't seem to import your CSV file in SquirrelMail, try breaking the file up into separate files of 100 lines or less. Try multiple times if it keeps asking you for the file. If 100-line files do not work, try breaking the files into even smaller chunks. You must import at least three fields for it to work, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>nickname, and</li>
<li>either last or first name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once uploaded, assign each field to the column. Maximum file size for upload is 5KB; approximately 100 lines. Nicknames must also be unique.</p>
<h2><span id="What_can_I_do_if_my_mailbox_is_full.3F" class="mw-headline">What can I do if my mailbox is full?</span></h2>
<p>If your mail user runs out of disk space, you'll be unable to receive new messages, as well as having a hard time deleting old ones. View the <a title="Disk Usage Warning" href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Disk_Usage_Warning">Disk Usage Warning</a> article for further details and solutions on how to resolve this.</p>
<h2><span id="My_calendar_data_disappeared" class="mw-headline">My calendar data disappeared</span></h2>
<p>If your calendar data has suddenly disappeared, contact <a title="Contacting DreamHost" href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Contacting_DreamHost">DreamHost support</a> as soon as possible. Support can check to see if there are any backups available to restore.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_there_an_attachment_size_limit_when_sending_mail_through_Webmail.3F" class="mw-headline">Is there an attachment size limit when sending mail through Webmail?</span></h2>
<p>Because Webmail is a PHP web application, it has lower limits for the email attachment size than emails sent through other methods. That limit is 7 MB. If you need to send a larger attachment, you must use a mail client such as Thunderbird.</p>
<h2><span id="The_SENT_folder_in_Webmail_is_duplicating_itself" class="mw-headline">The SENT folder in Webmail is duplicating itself</span></h2>

<pre>Sent

Sent.Sent
