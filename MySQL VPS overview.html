<h2>What is MySQL VPS?</h2>
<p>DreamHost MySQL VPS is DreamHost's premium shared MySQL database service. Similar in concept to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Private-server-overview">DreamHost VPS</a>, DreamHost PS MySQL uses Linux-VServer to offer an isolated database server.</p>
<p>This is different from the standard shared MySQL server which an account uses by default, as the shared MySQL server shares other users databases and resources. With the PS MySQL, your databases and resources are protected from other users in the same was a web private server is.</p>
