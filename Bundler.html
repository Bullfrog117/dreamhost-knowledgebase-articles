<h1><span id="What_is_Bundler.3F" class="mw-headline">What is Bundler?</span></h1>
<p>From the Bundler readme:</p>
<blockquote>Bundler is a tool that manages gem dependencies for your ruby application. It takes a gem manifest file and is able to fetch, download, and install the gems and all child dependencies specified in this manifest. It can manage any update to the gem manifest file and update the bundle's gems accordingly. It also lets you run any ruby code in context of the bundle's gem environment.</blockquote>
<p>This is the defacto standard for managing gem dependencies with Rails applications as of Rails 3.0, though it can be setup to work with Rails 2.3.5. Prior versions of Rails should <a class="mw-redirect" title="Freezing Gems" href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Freezing_Gems">freeze their gems</a> instead.</p>
<h1><span id="Getting_Started" class="mw-headline">Getting Started</span></h1>
<p>There are a few things you need to do in order to use Bundler effectively.</p>
<h2><span id="Install_Bundler_Locally" class="mw-headline">Install Bundler Locally</span></h2>
<p>Install Bundler 0.9.9 (see <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Bundler#Compatibility_Notes">Compatibility Notes</a> for why you want this version) on your local machine:</p>
<pre>gem install bundler -v 0.9.9
</pre>
<p>Make sure 0.9.9 is the only version installed with:</p>
<pre>gem list bundler
</pre>
<p>If newer versions are installed, you can remove them like so:</p>
<pre>gem uninstall bundler -v 0.9.10
</pre>
<p>If you're on a Mac, you might need to preface the above commands with "sudo".</p>
<h2><span id="Rails_2.3.5_Compatibility" class="mw-headline">Rails 2.3.5 Compatibility</span></h2>
<p>This step is only necessary if you're using Rails 2.3.5. Move on to the next step if you're using Rails 3.0 or higher.</p>
<p>You have to take a few special steps to get Bundler working properly with Rails 2.3.5 as mentioned in the Bundler readme and described <a class="external text" href="http://gist.github.com/302406" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The skinny is you need to make the following changes in your Rails application.</p>
<p>Edit your <strong>config/boot.rb</strong> file to add the following <strong>just above</strong> the Rails.boot! line at the end:</p>
<pre>class Rails::Boot
  def run
    load_initializer
    extend_environment
    Rails::Initializer.run(:set_load_path)
  end

  def extend_environment
    Rails::Initializer.class_eval do
      old_load = instance_method(:load_environment)
      define_method(:load_environment) do
        Bundler.require :default, Rails.env
        old_load.bind(self).call
      end
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Then add a <strong>config/preinitializer.rb</strong> file if you don't already have one with the following in it:</p>
<pre>begin
  # Require the preresolved locked set of gems.
  require File.expand_path('../../.bundle/environment', __FILE__)
rescue LoadError
  # Fallback on doing the resolve at runtime.
  require "rubygems"
  require "bundler"
  if Gem::Version.new(Bundler::VERSION) &lt;= Gem::Version.new("0.9.5")
    raise RuntimeError, "Bundler incompatible.\n" +
      "Your bundler version is incompatible with Rails 2.3 and an unlocked bundle.\n" +
      "Run `gem install bundler` to upgrade or `bundle lock` to lock."
  else
    Bundler.setup
  end
end
</pre>
<h2><span id="Get_Your_App_Using_Bundler" class="mw-headline">Get Your App Using Bundler</span></h2>
<p>Now, navigate to your app's root directory and run:</p>
<pre>bundle init
</pre>
<p>That will create a file named <strong>Gemfile</strong> in that root directory. Next, you want to edit that file, specifying your gem dependencies. You'll put all of those dependencies here rather than in your environment.rb file. You'll want to include at least Rails. You may also want to include Rack (in some cases it matters, in others it doesn't). A sample Gemfile may look like this:</p>
<pre>source :gemcutter

gem "rails", "~&gt; 2.3.5", :require =&gt; nil
gem "sqlite3-ruby", :require =&gt; "sqlite3"
gem "rack", "1.0.1"
gem "will_paginate", "2.3.12"
</pre>
<p>You can specify gems without a version number if you want the latest version.</p>
<h2><span id="Packaging_Your_Gems" class="mw-headline">Packaging Your Gems</span></h2>
<p>Now you want to run the following command on your application:</p>
<pre>bundle package
</pre>
<p>What this command does is pull in copies of the .gem files for all your dependencies and saves them in the <strong>vendor/cache</strong> directory. It then locks your application to the current versions of gems your application is using at that time, which will generate a <strong>Gemfile.lock</strong> file.</p>
<p>Note that this step is essential in DreamHost's system as it will perform all the necessary gem dependency resolution on your local machine. That process uses a fair bit of memory and will cause Bundler to get killed for using too much memory on DreamHost servers. By doing this on your local system, it allows Bundler to skip that step when performing the install.</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_Bundler_Files_to_your_Repo" class="mw-headline">Adding Bundler Files to your Repo</span></h2>
<p>If you're using SVN or Git (or something other SCM) for version control, you'll want to set it up to <em>ignore</em> the <strong>.bundle</strong> directory inside your application's root directory before checking in. That directory is created when you run <strong>bundle install</strong> and contains environment-specific information that will need to be rebuilt on the server you're deploying to. So, you want to make sure you add these files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gemfile</li>
<li>Gemfile.lock</li>
<li>vendor/cache/*</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Install_Bundler_Remotely" class="mw-headline">Install Bundler Remotely</span></h2>
<p>At this point, you'll want to log into your DreamHost shell account and make sure you have Bundler 0.9.9 (see <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Bundler#Compatibility_Notes">Compatibility Notes</a> for why you want this version) installed under your user there:</p>
<pre>gem install bundler -v 0.9.9
</pre>
<p>Once that's done, you're ready to roll. Deploy your application like you would normally.</p>
<h2><span id="Post_Deploy" class="mw-headline">Post Deploy</span></h2>
<p>Once you've deployed your application, you need to run this command on the server:</p>
<pre>bundle install
</pre>
<p>Then you want to restart your application. Assuming everything else with your application is working properly, your application should start loading properly. This has been tested with Passenger in our system and appears to work fine. There may be some gems that will cause you to run into additional issues, but in general this should work fine.</p>
<h1><span id="Compatibility_Notes" class="mw-headline">Compatibility Notes</span></h1>
<h2><span id="Bundler_0.9.10" class="mw-headline">Bundler 0.9.10</span></h2>
<p>This version of Bundler requires RubyGems 1.3.6, which breaks Passenger due to a bug in Passenger's load path that keeps stringio from loading properly. It also stops requiring the YAML gem by default, which has broken a number of gems. As such, DreamHost servers have not yet been updated to RubyGems 1.3.6 as of the time this was written. If you must have RubyGems 1.3.6, you can compile and install it yourself under your user, but for the purposes of using Bundler with Rails, simply using 0.9.9 for the time being should work fine.</p>
<h2><span id="Bundler_0.9.9" class="mw-headline">Bundler 0.9.9</span></h2>
<p>This version of Bundler was written against RubyGems 1.3.6, but does not explicitly require that version of RubyGems. Fortunately, all of its major functionality appears to work properly. To install an older version of Bundler, you need to use this syntax:</p>
<pre>gem install bundler -v 0.9.9
</pre>
<h2><span id="Older_Versions" class="mw-headline">Older Versions</span></h2>
<p>Older versions of Bundler had fairly major bugs and should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
