<p>Depending on how your site is constructed, it may be necessary to redirect requests for the primary URL to a subdirectory. For example, requests to example.com could go to example.com/blog. This is most often necessary with One-Click Installs.</p>
<p>Visit the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.installer&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Goodies’ &gt; ‘One-Click Installs’</a>) page to view available options.</p>
<p>When installing a One-Click Install:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target directory must be completely empty to succeed.</li>
<li>For example, if you want to put the installation in the directory /example.com, this directory must be empty and contain no files.</li>
<li>Another solution is to install the software into an empty subdirectory such as example.com/blog; then, you could create rules in an .htaccess file to automatically redirect requests for example.com to example.com/blog.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Redirect_.22ALL.22_requests_to_a_domain_to_a_subdirectory">Redirect "ALL" requests to a domain to a subdirectory</span></h3>
<p>You can redirect all requests to a subdirectory by adding an .htaccess file to the root of your domain’s directory:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the FTP page for instructions on how to upload.</li>
<li>Once connected, upload (or create) a text file named .htaccess (with no extension).</li>
<li>Make sure it’s uploaded to your domain’s directory such as example.com.</li>
<li>Add the following content to this .htaccess file:</li>
</ol>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blog/

# Rewrites all URLS [Replace "domain" with the actual domain, without the TLD (.com, .net, .biz, etc)]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?domain\.

# Rewrite all those to insert /folder
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /blog/$1 [L]
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example redirects all requests for a website automatically to a subdirectory named /blog. If you need to redirect to another directory, just change the two references of /blog to your subdirectory.</p>
<h3><span id="Redirect_.22ONLY.22_the_domain.27s_root_URL_to_a_subdirectory">Redirect "ONLY" the domain's root URL to a subdirectory</span></h3>
<p>The following example provides an alternative method of transparently redirecting. It works with any subdomain (including root/naked domains) and only transparently redirects a root request, while allowing directly requested subdirectories like example.com/other to be accessed.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} example\.com [NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /blog/$1 [L]
</pre>
</div>
