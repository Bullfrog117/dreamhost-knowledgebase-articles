<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a> is a major update to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the underlying communication protocol used to move data back and forth over the web. It’s the first major update to HTTP is nearly 15 years, and is rapidly seeing adoption growth and support in both browsers and web servers. DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> and <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> servers running <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216431827-Nginx-overview">Nginx</a> are capable of supporting HTTP/2 out of the box, with no additional user configuration required.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What benefits does HTTP/2 provide?</h3>
<p>HTTP/2 brings a number of new features to the table, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A binary protocol, making it more compact to ship over the wire</li>
<li>Fully multiplexed, parallel connections allow for faster, more efficient data transfer</li>
<li>Server push functionality, which allows web designers to build sites that proactively send assets that are needed by a web page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Will my site be compatible with HTTP/2?</h3>
<p>Yes! Browsers that support HTTP/2 will automatically use the newer protocol when connecting to an HTTP/2 webserver; browsers that don’t support HTTP/2 will seamlessly use HTTP/1.1, just as they currently do now. Websites won't display any differently over HTTP/2 than over HTTP/1.1, apart from potential performance increases and faster loading times.</p>
<h3>Is my TLS certificate compatible over HTTP/2?</h3>
<p>Yes. Your current Comodo, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216539558-Let-s-Encrypt-SSL-certificate-overview">Let’s Encrypt</a>, or third-party TLS certificate will work out of the box over HTTP/2.</p>
<h3>Can I use HTTP/2 for non-secured hosting domains?</h3>
<p>At this time, only secured hosting domains with a TLS certificate support HTTP/2. This is largely due to the current browser implementation landscape; there are no browsers currently supporting HTTP/2 connections over cleartext.</p>
<h3>Is HTTP/2 available for shared hosting?</h3>
<p>HTTP/2 is currently only supported for domains on VPS and Dedicated machines powered by Nginx. Shared hosting and DreamPress currently do not support an HTTP/2 connection.</p>
<h2>Enabling HTTP/2</h2>
<p>You can enable HTTP/2 support for your secured hosting domain running on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated server</a> powered by <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216431827-Nginx-overview">Nginx</a>.</p>
