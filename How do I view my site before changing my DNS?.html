<p>When you visit a website, you are redirected to the hosting company where your DNS is pointed. It’s also possible to upload your content to the DreamHost servers before you point your DNS to DreamHost and then view how the site will look on your DreamHost server. This article walks you through how to view the website you’ve uploaded to the DreamHost servers before this DNS change.</p>

<p>Some Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress have the domain name stored as a setting in the sites configuration file.</p>
<p>You can install and set up your site on a dreamhosters.com subdomain. But when it comes time to migrate the site to the primary domain, you’ll need to update the URLs in the database.</p>
<p>Visit this link at WordPress for further details on how to move the site to a new URL:</p>

<p>For temporary web viewing, you are able to add a subdomain of dreamhosters.com on your <a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page. For example, if your site is named example.com, you can set up a dreamhosters.com subdomain such as example.dreamhosters.com. Then, set that dreamhosters URL to MIRROR your primary website.</p>
<p>In the example below, your site is named example.com and the dreamhosters subdomain is named example.dreamhosters.com:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.

<li>Scroll down to the Mirrored section and fill in the two fields:
<ul>
<li><strong>Create the mirror at:</strong> Type in the dreamhosters.com address you wish to use. In this case, you’d type in "example.dreamhosters.com".</li>
<li><strong>Mirror this site:</strong> Select the name of your primary domain to be mirrored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Mirror this domain</strong> button to complete the setup. It may take up to 6 hours for this newly-created mirror to update, but once it does, you'll be able to access your domain (via this mirror) before you change the nameservers to point to DreamHost.</li>
