<p>Mail Mirroring lets you set one domain to automatically match another domain's email addresses.</p>
<p>For example, if you set blog.example.com to mirror example.com, all the email addresses you have individually set up on example.com will automatically work for blog.example.com.</p>
<p>This feature can only be used if example.com is using DreamHost-hosted mail service; if example.com is using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214984738-Anti-spam-overview">Anti-spam</a> filtering, you must enable it for blog.example.com as well.</p>
