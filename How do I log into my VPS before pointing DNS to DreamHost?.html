<p>If you want to access the server to perform configurations before you move your domain over, you can use the following form of a hostname in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> client (NOT in http):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>where <strong>psXXXXX</strong> is the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#Finding_your_FTP_server_hostname">hostname</a> of your VPS.</p>
<p>If you enter <strong>ftp://psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong> in a web browser, it would work; but <strong>http://psXXXXX.dreamhostps.com</strong> does not work. This is because http and FTP requests are handled differently: for http requests, the server shares IP addresses among domains, whereas for FTP requests, the server only needs the FTP username/password to know what content is in scope for its response.</p>
