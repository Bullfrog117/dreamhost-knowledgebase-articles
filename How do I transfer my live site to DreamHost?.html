<p>This page describes how to transfer your website and email hosting from your old provider to DreamHost. When you update your DNS, your site is then live on DreamHost's servers.</p>
<p>This article does not explain how to transfer the domain registration – only the hosting of your domain's files. View the following article if you also would like to transfer your registration:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Step one: Create a DreamHost account</h2>

</dl>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for any DreamHost plan [<a href="https://signup.dreamhost.com/">here</a>]. View the following article for details:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">How to signup for a DreamHost account?</a></li>
</ul>
<li>During the signup process, select an option to add your current domain to your new account and then add your domain. This does not affect your current live website.</li>
<li>Finish the signup process.

<div class="alert-content">
<p>DreamHost sends you a 'request to transfer the registration' after you complete the sign up, as well as information on how to access your FTP account. You do not need to transfer your registration. It can remain at your current registrar for now, which you can always transfer later.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step two: Backup your website files and upload them to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" alt="transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" width="617" height="209" /></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Backup all of your website files, databases, and emails from your old host via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217213327-Wget">Wget</a>. Contact your old host for their instructions on how to back up this content at their company.</li>
<li>Log in to your DreamHost <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP account</a>. Once logged in to your DreamHost server, you’ll be able to upload your website files to the server.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_03.fw.png" alt="transfer_site_toDH_03.fw.png" width="617" height="209" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Use the information in the following articles to upload your MySQL database and email to your DreamHost servers.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039938-How-do-I-migrate-my-database-to-DreamHost-">Migrate MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215730827-How-do-I-import-my-old-host-s-email-to-my-DreamHost-mail-server-">Transferring Emails</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step three: Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" alt="transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" width="617" height="209" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point your website and all its files are on DreamHost's servers, but your site is still 'hosted' at your old hosting company. You must now update your DNS to point to DreamHost.</p>
<p>Return to your old host and set the 'nameservers' for your domain registration to point to DreamHost using these nameservers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>This modification takes about 3–72 hours to propagate across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>
<p>You can track the progress of your DNS update here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">https://www.whatsmydns.net/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, your site will resolve to the data you’ve uploaded to your DreamHost servers.</p>
