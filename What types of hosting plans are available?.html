<p>DreamHost offers several different types of hosting plans running on the Ubuntu operating system. Most sites work well on the basic Shared hosting plan, however if your site is getting a large amount of traffic or if you need to make customizations not available to shared users, you may need to upgrade to a VPS, Dedicated, or DreamPress plan.</p>
<p>You can find further details at <a class=" " href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/" rel="nofollow">DreamHost Hosting</a> which describes the various options available to you as a DreamHost customer.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Shared_hosting">Shared hosting</span></h2>
<p>On a shared server, you 'share' server space with other customers. Though no other customer has access to your files, you and the other customers share the resources of the server. This means that if another website on the same server is receiving a large amount of traffic and using a lot of CPU resources, it's possible that your site may run slower as a result.</p>
<p>While DreamHost works hard to make sure all sites on a shared server never disrupt other sites, this is always a possibility due to the nature of shared hosting.</p>

<p>Shared hosting is perfect for blogs, portfolios, personal/business sites, and database-driven sites. Visit the following page for further information:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="VPS_hosting">VPS hosting</span></h2>
<p>The DreamHost Virtual Private Server (<a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>) is a premium hosting solution that runs on Solid State Drives (SSDs.) It is available as an add-on to an existing DreamHost plan or a standalone service.</p>
<p>DreamHost VPSs use Linux-VServer to create a "virtual machine" that protects a user's CPU and RAM resources from other users on the same physical machine. This is accomplished by kernel level isolation which allows the server to run multiple virtual units at once. Those units are sufficiently isolated to guarantee the required security, but utilize available resources efficiently, as they run on the same kernel.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_of_Shared_and_VPS_hosting">Comparison of Shared and VPS hosting</span></h2>
<p>On a shared server, resources are shared by other users. On a VPS, these resources are more isolated which improves performance and helps to maintain stability.</p>
<p>You also have the ability to control how much RAM your server uses. On a shared plan, this is limited to a specific amount; but on a VPS, you get to select how much RAM your server can use.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_can_I_host_on_a_private_server.3F">What can I host on a private server?</span></h2>
<p>A VPS is ideal for websites that require more resources than a shared server can provide, yet do not need the full power of a Dedicated server. It's ideal for businesses, ecommerce, designers, and developers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="VPS_pricing">VPS pricing</span></h2>
<p>A single VPS starts at $15/month and goes up to $120/month depending on the amount of RAM and storage space you require. View more information on the following page:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dedicated">Dedicated</span></h2>
<p>A Dedicated server is a server that only contains your websites and data on it. No other customers share any resources or have any access to it, as it's "dedicated" to you and your data.</p>
<p>You have full root access to customize it anyway you wish, but please note that DreamHost support cannot assist if any errors occur as a result of a customization.</p>
<p>Another feature is that your MySQL server is on the <em>same</em> Dedicated server allowing faster access, unlike with all other hosting plans where your MySQL databases are on a separate database server.</p>
<p>View the following page for further details on Dedicated plans:</p>

<p>Dedicated servers are Fully-managed business-class servers. They are perfect for resource-heavy apps and giant websites.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dedicated_pricing">Dedicated pricing</span></h2>
<p>Dedicated plans start at $169/month and go up to $249/month depending on the amount of RAM and storage you require. View the following page for further details:</p>

It's a scalable service that allows users to manage their WordPress sites with simple pricing, added benefits of server robustness, caching, and memory.</p>
<p>DreamPress uses both a <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> for the webserver and a <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">private database server</a> for your database. This is different from a standard <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> service where your databases are still on a shared database server.</p>
