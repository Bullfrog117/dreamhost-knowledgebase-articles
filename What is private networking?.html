<p>Private networking is a type of network in which all the servers connected
to that network are able to talk to each other and reach the rest of the
internet through a router, but the rest of the internet cannot initialize
a connection to those servers.</p>
<p>Private networking is ideal for running services that you wish to make
secure, as these services are unreachable from the internet and thus are
much harder to hack.</p>
<div id="enabling-private-networking">
<h2>Enabling private networking</h2>
<p>US-EAST 2 has public networking available by default which means every one of
your servers gets allocated a public IP address when it is created on that
network.</p>
<p>In order to enable private networking on your account in US-EAST 2, you must
contact support and make a request to enable it. Currently, this is unavailable
through the panel.</p>
