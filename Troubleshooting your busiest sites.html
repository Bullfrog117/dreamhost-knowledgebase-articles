<p>If the problem isn't specific to a single site but all your sites are affected, this is almost always because one of your sites is causing problems which affects all the others. In cases like this, it can be hard to know which site is causing the trouble. Here are some tips on how to proceed in those cases.</p>
<h2><strong>Checking for active processes</strong></h2>
<p>This is the first step. Many times you can tell which site is causing trouble by simply checking your active processes. Log into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> and take a look at which processes are running. Let's say you see something like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">top -c</span>
<span class="cmdoutput">top - 14:37:35 up 10 days, 17:35,  3 users,  load average: 0.83, 0.89, 1.11

</span></pre>
</div>
<p>In the above case, you can see that there are a lot of php5.cgi processes running under your user, but if you have more than one site that's less than helpful.</p>
<p>Assuming you’re running a PHP site, run the following command. If you’re not using PHP, just change the ‘grep php’ section to the language you’re using:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">lsof -u youruser | grep php | grep /home</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Ignore any errors you see in the response. What you’re looking for is the list of open files for your PHP processes. You can then look closer into those files to see what the issue may be.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding your busiest sites</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes the above method doesn't work well, which means you might need to investigate your busiest sites since those will likely be the ones causing the most trouble. The easiest way to find out which sites are your busiest is by checking the access.log file for each site – the larger it is, the more traffic it's getting (they're rotated daily). To do this, log into your account via SSH and run this command from your user's home directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">for k in `ls -S logs/*/http/access.log`; do wc -l $k | sort -r -n; done</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This command prints a list of your most active sites. Visit the following article for further information:</p>
