<p>On January 19 2017, DreamHost updated the SSL certificates on all mail servers. Because the SSL certificate was updated, you will see a message next time you open your mail client. This message will ask you to accept the new certificate. This certificate is completely safe for you to accept. Once your mail client saves the new certificate, your email client will function normally again. View the following article for futher details:</p>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215306748-Certificate-domain-mismatch-error-when-connecting-to-a-DreamHost-mail-server">Certificate error when connecting to a server</a>
<p><strong>Mac Mail users:</strong> There have been a few reported issues with Mac Mail not saving the new certificate at first. Try several times to accept the certificate with the 'Continue' button. Some users report that after a few tries, the certificate is saved. If it still cannot connect after these attempts, use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the Mail Server name on your account</a>. For example, sub5.mail.dreamhost.com. You can see which mail cluster your account users in the panel on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Support &gt; Data Centers')</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone users:</strong> First, try going to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts'. Click the account and address, then re-enter the hostname. If this doesn't work, try setting up the email account like new. Go to 'Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Accounts &gt; Add Account'. It will show the message "Cannot Verify Server Identity". Click "Details" below that message, followed by "Trust" in the top-right corner. Similar to the suggestion above, you may need to repeat this process 2-3 times to take effect permanently. You can also use your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail cluster for the server/host name</a> with this setup.</p>

<li>The iPhone automatically detects the rest of the settings and connects to your mailbox. However, in some cases, it may not properly connect the first few times. You may need to hit the <strong>Connect</strong> button again and try this a few times before it connects properly. This is a strange function within the mail program on the iPhone that causes this behavior.

<p>You can make the following changes in the Advanced section if you are experiencing any sync issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must set the <strong>IMAP Path Prefix</strong> to <big><strong>INBOX</strong></big> (all caps) for IMAP clients to work properly with DreamHost servers. Most desktop email clients work ok but instead show all the folders <em>under</em> the Inbox as sub folders rather than alongside it.</li>
<li>For sent messages, tap "Sent Mailbox" under the "MAILBOX BEHAVIORS" section, and then tap the folder to be used for sent messages (in the 'ON THE SERVER' section). Current choice has a paper airplane next to it.</li>

<li>If you are having trouble and suspect that you may have set something incorrectly, please refer to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214918038-Email-client-configuration-overview">Email Client Configuration</a> article or contact DreamHost support.</li>
<li>Recent versions of the iOS Mail client attempts to auto-detect whether the server supports POP3 or IMAP and select accordingly. To make the choice manually, give the Settings setup an incorrect email address, e.g., [your email address]bogus@[your domain]. The settings will not auto-detect, and you can then pick which protocol you want to use. Don't forget to fix your email address to [your email address]@[your domain].</li>
