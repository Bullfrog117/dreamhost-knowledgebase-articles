<p>You may notice the following error either when visiting your site or logging in to it:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at...'''</pre>
</div>
<p>This is essentially an issue with how the site is coded. Most often, this simply means something was sent to the browser before the header() was called. Technically speaking, once the header block has already been sent, you cannot add</p>
<p>additional header lines. Most often this is caused by your code sending output to the browser before the header() function. Make sure your header() function is set in your code before any output.</p>
<p>If you do not want to make any adjustments to your code, you can add the following in your phprc file to resolve this.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">output_buffering = 4096</pre>
</div>
