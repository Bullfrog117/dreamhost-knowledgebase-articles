<p>If you encounter an error message related to a plugin(s), you can try disabling it to see if that fixes the problem. You can do this by logging in to the WordPress dashboard and then clicking ‘Plugins’ on the left menu. You can then deactivate them one at a time on that screen.</p>
<p>If you are unable to log into the dashboard, you can log into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. Once logged in, navigate to the /example.com/wp-content/ directory. In that directory you’ll see the following folders:</p>
<p class="exampletext">/plugins <br />/themes <br />/uploads</p>
<h2><span id="Disabling_and_checking_all_plugins">Disabling and checking all plugins</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Rename the /plugins folder to /plugins_OFF. This immediately disables ALL of your plugins.</li>
<li>Check your site to see if that resolved the error.</li>
<li>If the error is resolved, rename the folder back to /plugins and then enter into the /plugins folder. In the /plugins folder, you’ll see a list of all plugins you have installed.</li>
<li>Rename each folder one at a time until you find which one is responsible for the error on your site.</li>
<li>Once you find out which plugin is the culprit, contact the developer directly. All WordPress.org hosted plugins and themes have a support forum.</li>
<li>Visit one of the following pages and leave a post that explains what happened (replace the 'themename' or 'pluginname' with the actual name):
<ul>
<li>https://wordpress.org/support/theme/THEMENAME, or</li>
<li>https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/PLUGINNAME.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
