<p>MICO (formerly known as Mantis) is a simple application for taking down and tracking phone calls. MICO stands for Mantis Inbound Call Organiser. If you run a small customer support center, this is a free way to keep track of inbound calls, add comments, escalate the call to another person and further track inbound calls towards call resolution.</p>
