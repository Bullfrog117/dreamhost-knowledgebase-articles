<p>There are several ways to redirect a URL. This is useful for those looking to redirect requests from their main domain to another directory under that domain. For example, such as directing requests for example.com to example.com/blog. This can be done using an <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215747748-How-can-I-redirect-and-rewrite-my-URLs-with-an-htaccess-file-">.htaccess file</a>. However, it's also possible to redirect using PHP.</p>
<p>This article gives you a quick example of how to create a redirect using PHP.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a file named index.php. You can create this on your home computer and upload to your domain's web directory via <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a>. You can also log into your server via <a href="https://dreamhosthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> and create the file directly in your web directory.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 PHP redirect.png" height="232" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_PHP_redirect.png" width="690"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Make sure the file is in the domain's directory. This directory is the one specified when adding the domain to your panel.
<dl>
<dd><em>You can also confirm by navigating to <a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) and clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of the domain.</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>In the example above, the domain is websitehelp.support. Your domain shows instead when viewing your settings page.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>In this index.php file, add the following line of code:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;?php header("Location: http://www.example.com/blog");Â ?&gt;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to change the sample URL to the URL you would like the site to forward.</p>
<p>You'll then have a simple and quick redirection that you can use to seamlessly redirect an HTTP request to any URL.</p>
