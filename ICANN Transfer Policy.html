<p>Effective December 1, 2016, ICANN is revising its Transfer Policy. The following is an overview of key points and how these changes may affect your account at DreamHost.</p>
<h2>What's changing?</h2>
<p>Previously called the “Inter-Registrar Transfer Policy”, this ICANN policy only covered transfers between different registrars.</p>
<p>ICANN is replacing this policy with the new “Transfer Policy” which includes the process of changing ownership from registrant to registrant. With the old policy, only inter-registrar transfers triggered the verification and notification process; with the new policy, updates that merely include the registrant’s first name, last name, organization, and email address will now trigger the same verification and notification process.</p>
<p>You can view the policy at the following link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en">ICANN Transfer Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How will this affect my account at DreamHost?</h2>
<p>DreamHost will leverage the designated agent policy option to implement this so that it's as painless for you as possible.</p>
<p>As stated in the ICANN Transfer Policy (1.2 “Designated Agent”), it allows an individual or entity that the Prior Registrant or New Registrant explicitly authorizes to approve a Change of Registrant on its behalf.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost will act as your Designated Agent, to approve any changes.</li>
<li>There will be an addition to DreamHost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/domain-registration-terms/">Domain Registrations Terms</a> for this, as follows:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>You authorize DreamHost to act as your “Designated Agent” to approve each “Change of Registrant” on your behalf (both terms are defined in ICANN’s Transfer Policy). Also, we will automatically implement a 60-day domain transfer lock following a “Change of Registrant” per ICANN’s new Transfer Policy.</blockquote>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>For security purposes, and as mandated in the policy by ICANN, you should expect that any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock; it will also trigger notification emails that are sent to the old and new registrant notifying them of the change.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>The 60-day lock will apply to all Change of Registrant situations. You should be aware of the fact that the 60-day lock can be avoided if you wait to change Registrant info <em>after a transfer has been initiated</em>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Registrant's name, organization, and/or email address</h3>
<p>As stated above, this will result in the notification process and 60-day lock. In most cases, there are 3–4 emails triggered and include the following:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>RAA verification (links to RAA article)</li>
<li>Success of changes from support@dreamhost.com</li>
<li>One to new registrant from:</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The new emails that are sent for this new process are notification emails, not actionable, so you do not need to take any action.</p>

<p>The above 60-day lock and emails also applies if the 'Use this information for Registrant, Admin, Tech and Billing records' box is checked in the panel:</p>
