<p>When you migrate a site from your old host to DreamHost, it's best to have everything set up and running before pointing your DNS. This is so there is no downtime when updating the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a>.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that until you change your DNS, you can only view your site as it resolves at the old host. The solution is to edit your computer's 'hosts' file. If you edit the 'hosts' file, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page. Add your site to the DreamHost panel and set it as FULLY HOSTED:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigate to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Goodies’ &gt; ‘MySQL Databases’</a>) page and create a new database.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Upload the contents of your website to your DreamHost server. Visit the FTP article for further details on how to upload:
